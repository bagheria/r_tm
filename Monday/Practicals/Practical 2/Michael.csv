AEG Live, the company that persuad¬ ed Michael Jackson to sign up for 50 nights at the O2 arena, is facing a liabil¬ ity of up to £300 million and a dark house for the next nine months. It was Randy Phillips, head of the
US entertainment company that turned the derelict former Dome into the UK's most popular new arena, who persuaded Jackson to return for a stunning series of ""farewell"" concerts, beginning next month. The announcement, fuelled by a rare public appearance by Jackson at
the venue, sparked an online frenzy, some 360,000 registering applications before sales had even opened. Within hours, one million fans had attempted to snap up tickets for an initial run of ten concerts, which rapidly turned into fifty. Tickets were immediately placed on
the secondary ticket market for up to £1,000. But Jackson's last reported public announcement on his residency at the O2 suggests that a combination of managers, advisers, concert promot¬ ers and those seeking to recover his debts, had let events spiral out of the singer's control. ""I don't know how I'm going to do 50 shows. I'm really angry,"" he said. Amid scepticism over whether the frail singer could complete the residen¬ cy, especially among insurance compa¬ nies, AEG Live said that it was pre¬ pared to ""self-insure"" the shows. Reinsurance magazine, which found that there was low demand in the London insurance market for the policy to cover all dates promoted by AEG Live, placed the liability at around £300 million. The first ten concerts are believed to have been placed on the London insur¬ ance market at a value of £80 million. Phillips had assured insurance brokers that doctors had spent five hours with Jackson, taking blood tests. ""He's a vegetarian, he's in great shape. The insurance cover, we are working on that now,"" Phillips said. But rather than lowering expecta¬ tions for the shows, AEG pumped out reports that Jackson would present the most spectacular live show seen on an indoor stage. Only this week, Jackson's PR ma¬ chine announced that ""extra tickets"" would be available for the shows, due to begin on July 13, and revealed that Jackson's stage cos¬ tumes would be studded with 300,000 Swarovski tl R
crystals. Ru¬ mours were
, uly ge d O2 arena: Jackson's tour Group, a sporting and men comp ues in ples C g had sold a million tickets
stoked that Jackson was preparing a stage move to succeed his famous ""moonwalk"". ""I would trade my body for his tomorrow. He's in fantastic shape,"" said Phillips, amid reports, furi¬ ously denied by Jackson's advisers, that the singer was suffering from skin cancer. Even at midnight, after Jackson's death was confirmed, the O2 website was still advertising the This Is It tour, and directing fans towards a Jackson website, headlined ""the time has come"" and promising fans their final audience with the King of Pop. The death has major implications for Seatwave, the company that trad¬ ed in around 10,000 Jackson tickets on the secondary market, in partner¬ ship with the O2 arena, often for a price far above face value. The company placed a message on its website saying: ""We at Seatwave are saddened by Michael Jackson's death. Our condolences go to Michael Jackson's family and appreciate the great legacy he has left us."" AEG Live's website said that fans who could not make the dates resched¬ uled after the opening dates had been cancelled would get. a full refund. That promise will now be honoured for one million customers. Ticketmaster, which also sold Jack¬ son tickets, has a policy to refund the face value of the ticket. AEG Live is a subsidiary company of the Anschutz Entertainment music entertain¬
ment company. The company owns ven¬ including the Sta¬ Center in Los An¬ geles and the
Manchester Evening News Arena."

Chris Ayres Los Angeles It remains to be seen whether Ameri¬ cans will remember Michael Jackson for his music. Here, after all, was a man from the rust bucket of Gary, Indiana, who made a fortune that must have been close to $1 billion and then proceeded to squander it, in the full glare of flashbulbs. Here was a man who disfigured him¬ self with increasingly grotesque plastic surgery until he turned from black to white and then wrote a song, Black or White, to declare that the colour of your skin didn't matter anyway. And here was a man who locked himself away in a self-constructed prison called Neverland with a private zoo full of pet animals, a miniature steam train, and a Ferris wheel that he could ride alone. And that's before we get on to the inevitable topic of Jackson's Peter Pan obsession, which was either a front for an unhealthy interest in boys, as one prosecutor in Santa Barbara County infamously tried and failed to prove, or one of many symptoms of a two- decade-long mental breakdown that
might have ultimately contributed to his early death last night, at the age of only 50. Then again, that Michael Jackson died young probably shouldn't come as such a surprise. He lived about twenty lifetimes in the space of one. He began his career as a professional singer at the age of 8. The child was so preternaturally talent¬ ed while still of first school age — he could manipulate tunes with all the skill of a Sam Cooke or a Ray Charles
— that many venue bookers suspect¬ ed his father, Joe, was a fraud. They thought that he had bought a midget and was passing him off as a child. After all, what kind of child could dance that well? The young Michael could dance as well as he could sing. So as soon as Berry Gordy of Motown Records got a hold of him, there was never any doubt that he was going to be a star. But the surprise was that he became more than a star: he became a global mega-brand — a feat that might never occur again in quite the same way, in this age of decentralised media. Perhaps even more astonishing than that was the fact that he was black — easy to forget in these days of President Obama. Twenty years earlier, a young Afri¬ can American man who grabbed his crotch and made girlish squeaking noises while singing wouldn't have been let through the front doors of many musical establishments. Perhaps his songs would have been repackaged by a white man and taken to the top of the charts but that would have been the end of it. The phenomenon of Michael Jackson, a name so well known that it was up there with Jesus and Ronald Reagan, could never have existed. And it's worth emphasising that Jackson wrote his own songs. Beat It and Billie Jean, perhaps the most famous tracks from Jackson's most famous album, Thriller, which sold a million copies a week at one point and remains the bestselling album in his¬ tory, were his own compositions. Not even the Beatles could boast that trio of talents: song-writing genius, natural vocal ability and dance moves that bordered on professional athleticism. When you mixed all this up with Jackson's appetite for capitalism — he didn't flinch at multimillion-dollar Pepsi endorsement deals and he infa¬ mously gazumped his friend Sir Paul McCartney with an astronomical offer for the Beatles' back catalogue — you ended up with a uniquely 20th- century American creation. As with the US of the 1980s itself, you marvelled at the limitless opportu¬ nity, the vast sums of money and the sheer spectacle — and yet at the same time a part of you dreaded where it might all lead. And with Jackson, of course, it led to Neverland, and that little steam train that he would ride around his empty ranch, by himself. The neighbours used to know that he was home when they heard the whistle echoing through the Santa Ynez Valley. One of them described it as the ""most lonesome sound you've ever heard"". It is said that Peter Pan's creator, the British author J. M. Barrie, was in¬ spired to create that character by the death of his brother in a skating

accident at the age of 7. Barrie's mother never got over it. Jackson, meanwhile, was told from an early age that showmanship was everything. And so he always tried to shock and entertain the crowd, even when that crowd was composed of just about every human being on earth. It sent him half-way insane in the end, to the point where he wilfully turned himself into a circus freak, but then couldn't tell the difference between freakishness and reality. It damaged him so much that the only people he would relate to were children. Whether it ever went any further than that, we will never know. But for all the madness, what Jack¬ son leaves behind, more than any¬ thing else, is some of the greatest American music of the 20th-century. And perhaps it is for the music, not the circus that went with it, that he will be remembered. Perhaps.

He added: ""I find it hard to believe this could be a reality.

Conspiracy surrounded Kurt Cobain
Ben Macintyre Commentary
P op stars die young. They die from bullet, drug abuse or accident. Even when they die old, they still seem to be young. But Michael Jackson's death was different. From the moment he achieved fame he seemed to be dying, in the public eye, through a series of grim and self-destructive images: his face changing from healthy black to skeletal white; in later years masked like a plague victim against the ordinary threats of the world. In the four decades of pop music he spanned, Jackson seemed to be fighting old age and time at every turn, infantilising himself, searching for Peter Pan, creating his own fantasy ranch in a hopeless search for lost youth, and yet his death was that of a prematurely old middle-aged man: a suspected coronary, at 50. The deaths of pop stars usually come tinged in technicolour: John Lennon gunned down outside the Dakota; Karen Carpenter whittled away by anorexia; Jimi Hendrix choking on his own vomit; Buddy Holly crashing in the Midwest,
recalled by Don McLean as the day the music died. But the day Michael Jackson's music died seemed almost impossibly predictable, the chronicle of a death foretold, by him. Think of the images of Jackson, and almost all seem presciently morbid: Jackson attending court on abuse charges; dangling his child, madly, over a balcony; giving a press conference in London to announce a. tour that would never happen, but seeming to announce Jt as a valedictory, the last time. The end. When the actor Heath Ledger was found dead on his bed in a New York apartment last year, it seemed to fit a pattern: a gifted individual, dead before his time, destined to live gorgeously for too brief a season. Jackson was different: he had been self-destructing in front of the cameras for so long, becoming ever odder, and thinner, and more unpredictable, that it seemed he would go on forever. A strange iconography seems to gather around the death of pop stars. Kurt Cobain, lead singer of the American band Nirvana, was found dead at his home in Seattle with a shotgun and a suicide note. The death certificate stated that death came from a ""shotgun wound
Michael Jackson News
to the head"" and an overdose, and concluded that his death was a suicide. Immediately a cult of conspiracy theories grew around his death. Buddy Holly's death was so sudden and so unexpected that it immediately plunged into song and myth. In a 1978 interview, Bruce Springsteen said: ""I play Buddy Holly every night before I go on; that keeps me honest."" John Lennon's murder in 1980 was so deeply shocking that it turned a nondescript 25-year-old man — ""a nobody"", in his own
'He seemed to be fighting old age and time at every turn'
words — into an instant celebrity (which was what he wanted — Mark David Chapman became somebody and has been in prison ever since), For a man who had to generate as many headlines for his lifestyle as his music, Jackson's death seems by contrast strangely predictable, and the more tragic for that. Other stars have seemed, with hindsight,headed for self-destruction — Hendrix and Brian Jones — but Jackson seemed to see it coming, which may be why
he fought it so weirdly, and so sadly. The Greeks knew that ""Those whom the gods love die young"". Billy Joel lamented that ""only the good die young"", while The Who sang: ""Hope I die before I get old"". The Romantics made a cult of young death, epitomised in Henry Wallis's 1856 painting The Death of Chatterton, a stunning painting but also a morbid celebration of pointless death and wasted genius. We have inherited that through, principally, the slow self-destruction of pop stars: witness the acres of space devoted to the spiralling self-harm of a Pete Doherty or an Amy Winehouse. In a strange way one might see Jackson's determination to make himself forever young, a child in a man's body, a different skin colour, a different voice, and a different face from the one he was born with, as fulfilment of Dylan Thomas's exhortation to ""rage against the dying of the light"". So much in Jackson's life was lurid, embarrassing, and strange. Yet his death was none of these. A brilliant artist passed in a way that was, by contrast with his prematurely dead peers in the pop trade, almost mundane, an ordinary death from a common disease. Perhaps, in a way, that was Jackson's vindication."
"June 27, 2009","","['Obituaries']","Michael Jackson","2009-06-27",".-A"" **«■:.;","Michael Jackson","Remarkable singer and songwriter who mesmerised the world with his electrifying performances, his eccentricities and his troubled personal life
— + He liked to be known as the King of Pop, and only a handful of performers — Presley, Sinatra, the Beatles — could challenge Michael Jackson for the title of most successful popular music entertainer of all time. Although ill health dogged his career in later years, and his reputa¬ tion was irrevocably tarnished by the allegations of child abuse levelled against him in 1993 and again in 2004, the sheer scale of Jackson's achieve¬ ments remains undiminished. With sales of about 53 million copies, Thrill¬ er, his magnum opus, released in 1982, remains by far the bestselling album ever released. The follow-up, Bad, from 1987, has sold 28 million copies and sales of Dangerous (1991) stand at 29 million. His total record sales were estimated by his Sony Music label to be in excess of 750 million. These stag¬ gering figures mark only some of the peaks ofa career begun at the age of 5. Born in 1958, in Gary, Indiana, Michael was the seventh of nine child¬ ren born to Joe Jackson and his wife Katherine (nee Scruse). Joe was a steel mill worker who in his spare time played guitar in an R&B group called the Falcons. Katherine, a devout Jehovah's Witness who played clari¬ net, piano and sang, worked as an assistant in a department store. Under Joe's strict tutelage and with encouragement and support from Katherine, five of the brothers formed a group called the Jackson 5 with Michael as the lead singer. The sixth, Randy, was still too young but event¬ ually joined the line-up much later on, while of. the sisters, LaToya enjoyed limited success as a solo act in adult life, and Janet eventually became a star in her own right. ""I was so little when we began to work on our music that I don't remember much about it,"" Jackson mused in his autobiography Moonwalk, published in 1988. ""When you're a showbusiness child, people make a lot of decisions concerning your life when you're out of the room."" The book's title was a refer¬ ence to the distinctive and deft foot- shuffling dance that he performed on stage and made his own. Joe Jackson managed the group with a rod of iron and in later life Michael spoke regretfully of the rift which developed and was never healed between him and his father. Nevertheless, Jackson Sr successfully steered the group from talent competi¬ tions and a residency in the local strip¬ tease parlour to a recording contract with Tamla Motown records, signed in 1969 reputedly for a dismal 2.7 per cent cut of the royalties. Success with Motown was instanta¬ neous and spectacular, as the group's first four singles — / Want You Back, The Love You Save, ABC and 111 Be There — all went to the top of the US chart, each title selling over a million copies. Michael was 11 when he first saw his own face on the cover of
Rolling Stone magazine. In 1971, two years after the Jackson 5's first hit, Michael was signed separately to Mo¬ town as a solo act and immediately sal¬ lied forth with a string of his own hits — Got to be There, Rockin' Robin, Ben (a US No 1 in 1972) and others — which were released in tandem with his work as a member of the group. In 1975, frustrated by the Motown supremo Berry Gordy's unwillingness to let them write or produce their own material, four ofthe Jackson 5, includ¬ ing Michael, joined the exodus of acts from the ailing label. Changing their name to the Jacksons for contractual reasons, they signed to Epic, where they teamed up with the celebrated writing and production team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The results were mixed. The single Show You the Way to Go was the group's first and only UK No 1 in 1977, but the album Goin' Places, released later the same year, failed to reach the US Top 60. In 1979 Jackson accepted an offer to co-star with his longstanding friend and mentor Diana Ross in The Wiz, a film version of The Wizard of Oz. While working on the film he met the veteran producer Quincy Jones and invited him to produce his next solo album, Off the Wall. This was the col¬ lection which marked the start of Jack¬ son's passage to the super league, and took his success as a solo artist into realms beyond anything achieved by the Jacksons. It has sold 19 million copies to date. Even so, no one was fully prepared for the epoch-making success of Thriller. Again produced by Jones, the album yielded an incredible total of seven Top Ten hit singles in America. Retail¬ ers reported that Thriller's appeal reached far beyond the normal strata of record buyers, attracting people who had never previously visited a record shop in their lives. Even a docu¬ mentary, The Making of Michael Jack¬ son's Thriller (1984), quickly became established as the bestselling music video ever released. Quite why Jackson should have
been so phenomenally successful at this point is difficult fully to explain. Musically, he was not a great innova¬ tor like Elvis Presley or Bob Dylan, nor was he a role model for a genera¬ tion like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones had been before him. But he emerged as a spectacularly talented all-rounder at a time when pop music was taking over as the world's primary mainstream entertainment. He was as good a dancer as he was a singer and he employed the new technology to make videos that were as full of stylish impact as his music. The appeal of his impossibly slick and electrifying song- and-dance routines transcended barri¬ ers of age, race, class and nationality. Above all, Jackson was a stringent perfectionist. He explained why it had taken five years to release Bad, the follow-up to Thriller. ""Quincy and I decided that this album should be as close to perfect as humanly possible. A perfectionist has to take his time. He can't let it go before he's satisfied. He can't. When it's as perfect as you can make it, you put it out there. That's the difference between a No 30 record and a No 1 record that stays No 1 for weeks."" Bad was very much in the latter category, as was Jackson's next album, Dangerous, released in 1991. And even HIStory — Past, Present and Future — Book 1, an unwieldy double album combining 15 greatest hits and 15 new songs released after the torrent of bad publicity surrounding the first allega¬ tions of child abuse in 1993, had achieved global sales of 18 million copies by the time of his death. Jackson did not react well to the relentless barrage of (frequently pruri¬ ent) media attention which was gener¬ ated by success on such a grand scale. ""Success definitely brings on loneli¬ ness,"" he wrote in Moonwalk. ""People think you're lucky, that you have everything. They think you can go any¬ where and do anything, but that's not the point. One hungers for the basic stuff."" In Santa Barbara county, California, Jackson built himself a fantasy ranch called Neverland — a reference both to J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan (perhaps sig¬ nificantly, the boy who never grew up), and to Elvis Presley's Graceland home in Memphis, Tennessee — where he created a zoo, a miniature railway and a Ferris wheel. But as he became an increasingly reclusive and secretive figure, so re¬ ports of his eccentricities became ever more lurid and fantastic. In Britain, The Sun newspaper posed the question that came to dominate popular reportage of his private life: ""Is Jacko Wacko?"" He was known to have kept snakes and a pet chimpanzee called Bubbles who, it was said, slept in the same room as Jackson. He attempted to buy the bones of Joseph (John) Merrick, the so- called Elephant Man, after seeing the movie starring John Hurt. He was

photographed wearing a face mask, to ward off germs, and sleeping in an oxy¬ gen chamber, a practice which he apparently believed would help to prolong his life to 150. He was known to have had a nose job and a cleft put in his chin, but Jack¬ son categorically denied persistent allegations that he had had his whole face restructured and his skin tinted a shade lighter than its natural tone. As he got older, though, his features became oddly contorted and he took on a distinctly unhealthy pallor. ""I have a skin disorder which destroys the pigment of my skin,"" he told Oprah Winfrey in February 1993. ""It's in my family. We're trying to con¬ trol it. I am a black American."" When his Bad tour reached Eng¬ land in 1988, Jackson's constant com¬ panion was the American television child actor Jimmy Safechuck. In London, the pair paid an after-hours visit to the Regent Street toy store- shop Hamleys. It seemed as if Jack¬ son, having started his career so young, had been forced to stretch his childhood well into adult life. ""I believe I'm one of the loneliest people in the world,"" he wrote, in what was to become the most frequently quoted remark from his Moonwalk book. But as he approached middle age, it was Jackson's abiding interest in child¬ ren which was his undoing. In August 1993 the Los Angeles Police Depart¬ ment announced that he was under criminal investigation after allega¬ tions by a Beverly Hills dentist that Jackson had molested his 13-year-old son, Jordan Chandler. The story pro¬ voked a prolonged ""feeding frenzy"" among the world's media, and Jack¬ son eventually settled out of court, paying the Chandlers a sum believed to be in the region of $26 million to drop the case, while continuing vigor¬ ously to protest his innocence. The announcement, some months after the event, that on May 26,1994 Jack¬ son had been married to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of the late Elvis Presley, was initially greeted with dis¬ belief and subsequently derided as a cynical PR public relations ploy, designed to repair Jackson's tattered image. But at least neither partner could be accused of marrying for a stake in the other's fortune. Their com¬ bined worth was said to be close to half a billion dollars. The marriage last¬ ed only 17 months. In 1997 Jackson was married to Debbie Rowe, a 37-year-old nurse, who bore him two children, Prince Michael I and Paris Michael Kather¬ ine before leaving him (and the child¬ ren), and filing for divorce in 1999. It was ironic that a near-fanatical interest in fitness was in itself the cause of concern about Jackson's health. Rail-thin all his life, he was a strict vegetarian who put himself through various punishing regimes involving days of fasting and long spells of obsessive dance practice. In 1979, while working on The Wiz, he burst a blood vessel in his lung. In 1988 he collapsed onstage during one of the Bad shows in Europe, and in 1990 much was made of a suspected heart attack which turned out to be an inflamed rib cartilage, damaged through excessive exercise. He can¬ celled the last six dates of the Euro¬ pean leg of the Dangerous tour in 1992, because of ""throat problems"", continued on next page +

+ continued from previous page and in 1993 publicity surrounding the child abuse allegations reached a peak, the South-East Asian leg of the same tour collapsed in disarray, and Jackson retired to undergo treatment for an addiction to painkillers. It was not until December 1995 that he at¬ tempted a return to live performance. But disaster struck again when he col¬ lapsed during rehearsals for a show that was to have been televised world¬ wide from New York. He was rushed to hospital suffering from low blood pressure, dehydration and a suspected virus affecting his heart. Jackson's next full-length album, Invincible (2001), was a creditable col¬ lection of R&B songs which sold six million copies, a huge success if jud¬ ged by any standards other"" than those of Jackson's earlier work. A greatest-hits compilation, Number Ones (2003), sold well over a million copies in Britain alone, despite the almost con¬ tinual controversy that by now surrounded him. Almost a year earlier, after fathering another son, Prince Michael II, with an un¬ identified surrogate mother, he dangled the baby perilously over the balcony of a Berlin hotel. The pictures, circu¬ lated around the world, prompted questions about his suitability as a parent. There was further cause for concern when a TV interview with the docu¬ mentary film-maker Martin Bashir, first screened in Brit¬ ain in 2003, revealed a mid¬ dle-aged man trapped in a

child's mindset. More disturbingly, Jackson's admission in the same inter¬ view that he routinely slept with child¬ ren in his room created further lurid speculation and led to his arrest by the Santa Barbara police, who charged him with molesting a 13-year-old boy. Jackson's lawyers promised that there would be ""no quarter"" given in their efforts to defend him, and fans were vocal in protest. ""His life has been about peace,"" insisted Jackson's elder brother Jermaine. The case opened on January 31, 2005, and the huge media circus out¬ side the Santa Maria court was not dis¬ appointed as Jackson provided it with an almost daily supply of dramatic stories. Even before the jury had been sworn in, he announced a list of star witnesses that included Diana Ross, Elizabeth Taylor and Stevie Wonder, although in the event none was actually called to the stand and Jackson required to so, the strain on him visibly so. He twice attention, once for symptoms and once for back point, Judge Rodney threatened to revoke the million bail and lock him rest of the trial after shuffled in weakly, more late, wearing his June 14, almost five the trial began, Jack¬ sensationally acquitted of charges of child abuse, which carried a maxi¬ sentence of more than years in prison. Hun¬ of fans who had kept a vigil outside the courthouse celebrated with abandon. But for Jackson, grim- faced and by now extremely fragile,
there was only relief that the ordeal was over and that he still had his free¬ dom. In the aftermath of the trial he sought refuge from the public eye in Bahrain, where it was reported that he had bought a property close to the pal¬ ace of his friend Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al Khalifa. Yet another greatest hits compila¬ tion — The Essential Michael Jackson — sailed to No 2 in the UK chart, but could only limp into the American chart at No 128, a disastrous showing for the man who once reigned supreme as the King of Pop. Jackson's last years were marked chiefly by stories of financial difficul¬ ties brought on by years of extrava¬ gant spending. He moved out of Nev¬ erland and at the time of his death was living with his children in a mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles, which he was renting for $100,000 a month. His fans remained loyal, however. The singer's death came only weeks before he was due to begin an unprece¬ dented series of 50 concerts in London at the O2 arena in Greenwich. When the performances were announced there was a strong suggestion that they might be Jackson's last, and that he would retire when they were over. The dates sold out at once. Ominous¬ ly, the first four concerts, beginning on July 13, were postponed because Jack¬ son needed more time to rehearse. The pop star had come to look increasingly frail and had long been erratic in his behaviour. What his true character was like is difficult to say, it being heavily camouflaged by music industry public relations hype and lurid media speculation. He had spent almost his entire life in the showbusiness spotlight. Michael Jackson, pop singer, was born on August 29,1958. He died on June 25, 2009, aged 50"

The list of prescription drugs that Michael Jackson was reported to have taken includes drugs from three main chemical classes. Those most frequently referred to are the anti-depressant sertraline, known as Zoloft in the US and Lustral in Britain, the * alium-like tranquilliser alprazolam (Xanax) and the morphine-like painkiller pethidine (Demerol). It is reported that Jackson collapsed shortly after an injection of Demerol, presumably administered by a doctor or nurse. The timescale is not clear, but the limited interval between the injection and his collapse suggests that the two may have been linked.
All tranquillisers and morphine-like painkillers are known to affect patients' breathing patterns, especially if taken in excessive doses. Doctors know that the large single doses of opiates and sedatives given to patients in their final hours to relieve pain could shorten their lives by depressing their respiratory efforts. When two drugs are given together, especially if they are from different classes, the effects do not simply combine — they multiply. Doctors make use of this when treating high blood pressure where low doses of two drugs given simultaneously are often more effective than high doses of one or the other. But the multiplication principle also holds true for
unwanted effects. The death of the actor Heath Ledger last year was attributed to the combination of Xanax with another opiate painkiller, oxycodone. The sedative effect of previous doses of Xanax, combined with an injection of Deinerol, could have been responsible for the apparent shallowness of Jackson's breathing in the minutes that followed. By the time that the 911 call had been logged by the emergency services his breathing had stopped altogether. The sedation resulting from the drug combination may well have removed the desire for him to breathe for himself as surely as if the drugs had been administered by an anaesthetist When breathing stops and the
heart is deprived of the oxygen required to function a cardiac arrest is inevitable. As soon as a patient collapses the priority is to re-establish some sort of circulation and to provide essential oxygen, usually by administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If the cause of collapse is known it is mandatory to deal with that too. A collapse as a result of a heart attack is often due to a pulse abnormality known as V-fib (ventricular fibrillation) and a couple of shocks from a defibrillator may restore the heart's normal rhythm. If the reports are accurate, the short time between the injection and the collapse would mean that the doctor who injected the
Demerol would probably have considered administering an opiate antagonist (or antidote) to reverse any respiratory depression. The effects of the most commonly used antidote, naloxone, are short-acting but the time it buys the emergency response team, allowing them artificially to ventilate a patient, is invaluable. But even in the best situations, attempts at CPR are not always successful. Jackson was known to be physically frail, reportedly weighing as little as 7st, and to be under great stress. Perhaps it is not sutprising that the paramedics and emergency room staff were unable to revive him. Dr Lobley is a general practitioner in South London"

e was a great friend, a very sensitive, gentle, gifted man. My brothers and I first met him in about 1972 when he was in the Jackson 5. We were in the same studio, the Hit Factory, in Los Angeles. Every time he was in Miami he would stay over, particularly with Barry. He often showed up out ofthe blue: he used to leave Bubbles with someone and come on his own. We hung out, had jam sessions. I last saw him a few weeks ago in LA at a party. He looked well but he wasn't well — he was worn down. He was very, very wary about going back into the limelight, and I sympathised with that. It wasn't the London dates so much that bothered him, it was the way the critics might evaluate him after those dates. I told him he should say, ""So what!"" instead of ""What if?"" The fact was that he wasn't afforded the respect that he deserved — here was a guy who was acquitted in his trial last year but in, America particularly, he was very troubled. He was very frightened of doing live stage shows after the trial because he was worried about the attacks that might occur. I think it really got to him. The problem is he was very fragile—the nature of artists is that they are sensitive and soft. But that doesn't detract from their intelligence and their talent. His death wasn't a huge surprise — I just wish people wouldn't have hounded him so much. He was a very lonely man and misunderstood. He had to do it on his own. He underwent a lot in the last two years and I don't think many people could have stood up to as much as he did. We had a shared camaraderie. He will be sorely missed because this didn't have to happen. He was young, like my brother, who died in 2003 — of course, Michael came to Maurice's funeral. It's so sad that we can't praise people while they're here in the world. When they're gone it's too late. The people who were down on him last year are praying to the altar of Michael Jackson today.

MICHAEL JACKSON 1958-2009
ow that Michael Jackson is dead perhaps the closet Jacksonphilia that has been quietly rippling through fashion over the past year will openly declare itself. For while fashion critics couldn't fail to notice that Balmain, currently the world's hottest label, has been enthusiastically plundering Jackson's back catalogue of '-^fashion moments for several seasons, Jack¬ son alive remained too controversial a figure even for fashion to embrace whole¬ heartedly. Even though his crystal-embellished h shoulder pads and military style jackets * had filtered into the high street (along with a craze for skinny black leather trousers) and singers from Justin Timberlake to the Killers' Brandon Flowers have followed his fashion lead, open adoration of his style was best left to the diehard groupies. Until Thursday.
Yet of all the pop figures of the past 30 years — and arguably the past 50—Jack¬ son was the most immediately recognis¬ able. Iconic is one of the most overused words in modern cultural analysis but in his case it may be justified. It wasn't a Michael Jackson look, it was The Michael Jackson Look, one that, with a few tweaks here and there, endured from 1979's Off the Wall and lasted until his death. In fact, thanks to Balmain, Jackson, who had recently acquired some of the house's pieces for himself, had stylistically come full circle. If Madonna is a shape-shifter who takes on numerous personas and then moves on, the building blocks of The Jackson Look re¬ mained constant for most of his career. He may have drawn from the prevailing silhou¬ ettes of the Eighties but with the help of theatrical costume designers such as Debo¬ rah Nadoolman Landis (who designed the red leather costume for Thriller, the semi¬ nal, MTV-changing video that her hus¬ band, John, directed), Michael Bush and Dennis Tompkins, he pumped them up to cartoonish proportions and made them his own. The current trend for commissioning big-name catwalk designers to work on stage costume had not yet taken flight. But the results were nonetheless collaborative — Jackson was too much of a perfectionist to be a passive participant when it came to creating his image. The big-shouldered jackets, the slightly too short trousers, the loafers, the aviator sunglasses, the rakishly tilted fedora (he was working the sexually ambiguous line long before anyone else in pop), the sequins — the man may have suffered from debilitating shyness, but those clothes could shout. But then, even as a teenager he favoured loud, colourful clothes. Yet however brash the clothes event¬ ually became, the contrast with his increas¬ ingly emaciated and stooped frame only highlighted his vulnerability and air of dis¬ location. As Jackson instinctively knew himself, it wasn't about the clothes per se (although he became catastrophically addicted to accumulating them, infamously never wearing the same outfit twice to his court case in 2005) so much as creating an icono¬ graphy. Every item became so much a part of his aura that even individually they became shorthand for essence of Jackson. The tasselled black patent loafers and the dazzling, pristine white socks sum up the genius of his styling: together, on the cover of Off the Wall, they create a symbol that is
as instantly emotive as the ears of Mickey Mouse. It's overwhelmingly tempting to con¬ clude that the reason Jackson—unlike the Beatles, who launched their career looking like (admittedly groovy) bank tellers in tailored grey Douglas Millings collarless suits and within the decade were dressing like Haight-Ashbury hippies, or even Elvis, whose transformation from Fifties rocka¬ billy to Vegas kitsch was at least a progres¬ sion of sorts — never moved on from The Look was because he never moved on. And he dressed similarly on and off stage because there was an unhealthy lack of distinction in his own mind between
public, personal, myth and the humdrum ofa normal everyday life. Or perhaps the adherence to The Look was part of a corporate strategy: he was at times an extremely astute businessman. But the truth probably is darker. The disas¬ trous addiction to plastic surgery, which made him look not only sexually equivocal (fashionable) but racially so (definitely not fashionable) suggests a tragic inability to come to terms with what he was. The boy who worshipped Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor spent his life attempting to become beautiful in the (white, female) way they were beautiful. And knowing somehow it wouldn't pan out."

The death of Michael Jackson brings fo an end the tragic third act of a remarkable life. The final, reclusive years were a descent into an increas¬ ingly bizarre and dysfunctional world of his own devising. The strange, plastic contortions of his face, the tales of sleeping in an oxygen tank, the personal amusement park populated by chimpan¬ zees and children and the allegations of child abuse — a whole life lived out in the glare of publicity had turned in on itself. Latterly, Jack¬ son was overwhelmed by lawsuits for unpaid bills. He was reported to have a critical lung con¬ dition and to need a transplant and, on his rare appearances in public, he cut a pitiable figure. There will be a great deal of raking over ofthe details, some of them sordid, of the life. But where life is short, art, of sufficient quality, will last much longer. And the music that Jackson created in two phases of fabulous creativity will be the story long after the peculiarities of his life have been relegated to the footnotes. The first creative flowering began when he was a child, Born in 1958, into a poor family in Gary, Indiana, Jackson was put on the stage,
with his four brothers, at the age of 6. The seeds of problems were probably planted at this time. Many years later Jackson accused his father of abuse and it is clear that he had no semblance of an ordinary childhood. For a grown man to call his ranch Neverland is surely the desperate plea of a boy who did not want to grow old, at least not before he had been allowed to be young. No human being should ever be a repository for the ambitions of another, a father or anyone else. So nobody should say that the music justi¬ fies the treatment. But the music is still there, all the same, and the early Jackson Five records have stood the only test of art that matters — the test of time. In a string of magnificent cuts for Motown — ABC, 1 Want You Back, The Love You Save, I'll Be There — Michael Jackson established himself, while still no more than a boy, as a vocalist of the first rank. There are some great recording artists whose reputation rests, and deservedly, on this golden period for Motown records. The reason Michael Jackson ranks higher than his contemporaries is because of the extraordinary second act to his
career. Between 1979, with the release of Off the Wall, and 1987, with Bad, Jackson and his brilliant producer Quincy Jones produced a trilogy of albums that both defined a new genre and marked its high point. In between the two, Jackson released the highest-selling album of all time, Thriller. In the process he upset all the usual musical categories, a black artist creating a new market, bigger than any before or since. Sales were helped enormously by the short films accompanying Billie Jean and Thriller that also made Michael Jackson the first great star of the video age. The tortured circumstances of Jackson's life meant that his best work had, almost without question, already been done. But we will still have a man in a pink shirt and a red bow tie, singing a plaintive lyric about disputed paternity, to a rhythm that demands you try to imitate his elastic movement. You need to hear the music, that insistent beat, and suddenly the talent is obvious. The singer dances lithely through the streets. He slides effortlessly up to a lamppost. He touches it and a light goes on."

Michael Jackson was celebrated yesterday on hastily produced T- shirts, irreverent shrines and in sponta¬ neous moonwalks through the mud as Glastonbury festivalgoers paid tribute to the singer. Although Jackson never played at the festival, his music is so influential that even people too young to remem¬ ber his heyday in the 1980s continued to chatter about his death as Thursday night's rumours were confirmed in the morning newspapers. One T-shirt maker experienced a rush of sales after he created two designs with the messages ""Michael Jackson RIP 1958-2005"" and ""A legend never dies"". Uygar Turantekin, 32, said: ""I heard the rumour at mid¬ night, so I made up these designs in about an hour. I'm pretty sure we will sell hundreds this weekend."" A makeshift shrine was erected at an art workshop near the Cabaret Tent. None of the drawings was sympathetic. A sketch of the singer was accompanied by a caption that read: ""RIP Michael Jackson. PS: Your tour is going to be rotten."" Visitors to the Greenpeace area of the site were invited to imitate Jack¬ son's moonwalk dance. Andy Fitch, 34, an actor who works in the Green¬ peace section, said that he was still in shock. ""It hasn't hit me yet. Regardless of all the negative stuff said about him in the past, I think he was a huge talent."" Mr Fitch said that he had heard scores of people singing Jackson's songs yesterday and had performed to ABC and Beat It in a singalong session. One shop, Loud Festival Store, com¬ mitted itself to playing nothing but Jackson's songs for the afternoon. John Shearlove, a spokesman for the festival, said that people were scep¬ tical when they first heard the news. ""For years we've had rumours going around the site — usually about Cliff Richard dying — and it turns out not to be true,"" he said. ""I did hear the rumour at around midnight,"" Ian, one of the stewards in the Welfare Tent, said. ""You could hear people saying, 'Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson' as they walked past. Then someone said that, actually, it was Michael Eavis [the farmer who runs Glastonbury] that had died. It got a bit Chinese whispers."" And had anyone been so upset by the news that they had recourse to call upon the welfare centre? ""No, I have to admit, no,"" Ian replied. Yesterday morning all conversa¬ tions were about which bands would be the first to mention Jackson onstage, and who would cover one of his songs first. In the event, it was the Whip, at midday, who shouted ""This one's for Michael Jackson!"" — and then played one of their own songs. Because, as many bands were swiftly realising, Jackson's songs are actually quite difficult to play. But some performers, including Gabriella Cilmi, worked Jackson's songs into their sets, to roars of approv¬ al from the crowds. Others were Pharrell Williams of N.E.R.D., whose cry of ""RIP Michael Jackson"" pro¬ voked an excited response. Lily Allen wore a white glove on one hand, one of Jackson's trademarks."

A cardiologist who was allegedly with Jackson when he collapsed on Thursday was at the centre of a police inquiry amid claims that Jackson had been receiving daily injections of Dem¬ erol, a synthetic painkiller similar to morphine. The coroner confirmed that he had not signed a death certif¬ icate. Detectives seized a car linked to
the doctor, and Karen Rayner, a police spokeswoman, said that it might con¬ tain ""medications or other evidence that may assist the coroner in deter¬ mining the cause of death"".

""This was something which I feared and which I warned about,"" said Mr Ox- man, who was with Jackson's sister La Toya and brothers Jermaine and Ran¬ dy at the hospital. ""This is a case of abuse of medication, unless there is another cause I did not know about."" Uri Geller, the self-styled psychic and friend of Jackson, told Sky News: ""Stress is a killer, any doctor will tell you that. I think the anticipation of this mammoth challenge that was coming upon him, doing these 50 con¬ certs, wanting to be close to perfection when he was going to be on stage, put him under huge, huge pressure.""

MICHAEL JACKSON 1958-2009
lhat Michael Jackson lived until the age of 50 is in many ways shocking. As one of the reporters who camped out in Santa Maria, California, during the spring of 2005 to cover his child abuse trial, there were times when I - doubted he would still be alive to hear the jury read its verdict. In my notes from the final day of testi¬ mony, before the jury retired, I observed that the defendant was ""tiny, weak, and with the flesh visibly shrinking from his face, leaving behind an almost skeletal jaw line made stranger by the pulled lips and white man's chin dimple"" and concluded that ""MichaelJackson is clearly in extreme¬ ly poor health"". Facing more than 18 years injail on ten child molestation-related charges — and forced to sit through 60 days of court pro¬ ceedings involving 135 witnesses and 1,000 ..pieces of evidence — Jackson suffered at ' least one complete mental and physical breakdown during the trial. Thejudge was not sympathetic. After being told by the judge that he would be arrested if he did not show up to court, the singer arrived almost two hours late, still wearing his pyjamas, with a flun¬ ky holding an umbrella over his head. Only a couple of months before, Jackson had been in such high spirits that he had moon- danced on the roof of his vehicle after a pre¬ liminary hearing. I doubt that anyone who sat through that trial, day after day, will be engaging in much sentimental talk about Jackson this ^weekend—regardless ofthe great sadness that always accompanies the death of a great pop culture icon. It is not that Jackson was obviously a child molester who happened to get lucky with a soft jury in 2005. That was not the case at all: the charges against him were overblown and should never have reached court. The accusers were hucksters with zero credibility — something that should have been obvious from the beginning to Tom Sneddon, the red-faced, shouty Santa Bar¬ bara County District Attorney, who seemed to have made a personal crusade
out of putting Jackson in prison. No, what made a little bit ofyour soul die every time you went to court was the spectacle of a man who had been so utterly corrupted by everything that's wrong with fame — to the point where he had quite literally muti¬ lated himself. Once you saw that tragic mask of a face up close, it never left you. And it was notjust the plastic surgery, or the large doses of prescription medication that the man was obviously taking—it was everything about his life. Contrary to the image he created for himself in his later years, Michael Jackson was no man-child, trapped in time. That was an act, and only his most doe-eyed of fans ever bought it. During the trial it became clear that the singer had two voices: the girlish showbusi¬ ness falsetto, and the gruff, grown man's baritone that he used to scold his employ¬ ees. And as with the facial alterations that had turned a black man into a white one, there was a sense Jackson loved the illu¬ sion. Indeed, his whole life was a series of circus mirrors, right down to the red wine he served himself on his private jet in Diet Coke cans. He had been a showman since the age of 8, so the sleight of hand came naturally. But it came so naturally that he didn't know when or how to stop. Which, of course, made him a terrible judge of character. Like a lottery winner with a lot of new friends, he surrounded himself with the very worst kind of people imaginable, most of whom spent their whole time trying to find new and innovative ways to scam a per¬ centage of his vast wealth which, until he squandered it, must have been worth close to a billion dollars. Practically everyone who ever met him ended up suing him. And his profligacy, which he never abandoned until his last days — he was broke but living at a $100,000-a-month mansion in Bel Air when he collapsed on Thursday — only made him an even bigger target. However, it was in 1993 that Jackson essentially destroyed himself. A boy named Jordan Chandler had accused the singer of grooming him as a sexual partner, and had provided the Los Angeles police with a vivid description of the singer's genitalia. In a gesture of co-operation with the police, Jackson agreed to a 25-minute strip search, and the match was not conclu¬ sive. But Jackson didn't go on to fightthe al¬ legations. For whatever reason he chose instead to pay the Chandlers to go away, with the sum estimated at an astonishing $20 million. The settlement did two things: it made Jackson look as though he had something to hide—and to this very day, we still can¬ not say for sure whether he did or did not; and it hung a financial bullseye over the singer's head, marking him out as the kind of weak-willed bleeding heart who would rather write a cheque than put up With another public humiliation. For someone
Jackson suffered at least one complete breakdown
with Jackson's lack of common sense and inability to surround himself by good, loyal people, this was a terrible, fatal mistake. All Jackson had known until 1993 was exploitation: whether he was doing it to himself, or if other people were doing it to him. But after the Jordy Chandler settle¬ ment, the wolves were circling, and the man who lived inside a children's play¬ ground called Neverland was raw meat. The sympathy for Jackson can go only so far, however. His relations with young boys may or may not have been illegal. But any level-headed parent would have con¬ sidered them grossly inappropriate — predatory, even. For example: the man went to extraordi¬ nary lengths to woo the mothers of the boys he befriended. During the 2005 trial, it emerged that the mother of the accuser was often sent offin a chauffeured Rolls- Royce to get spa treatments while her son was invited into the singer's bed, with its blue sequined sheets. What was he thinking? Only Michael Jackson ever knew the answer to that question. One thing was clear: the only people he could relate to were children, preferably boys. If you refused to believe that Jackson's motives were sexual—and while acknowl¬ edging the dubiousness of his behaviour, I still could never bring myself to believe it — then I suppose you could argue that children provided Jackson with the kind of pureness and honesty that he could not get from the adults in his life, who were always trying to rip him off. As for all those statues of naked boys he kept around Neverland, you could write it off as. bad taste — even though, taken as a whole along with everything else, it made your skin crawl. A less generous analysis might conclude that children simply fed his messiah com¬ plex. After all, this was a man who had com¬ missioned a giant replica of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper to hang over his king-sized bed. In the painting, Christ's face was replaced by Jackson's. The singer's disci¬ ples, meanwhile, were shown as Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, Little Richard, and, of course, Elvis Presley. Whatever his motives, Jack¬ son was clearly addicted to children — or to be more specific, other people's children — even when his pursuit of them acted directly against his own interests. And in the end it ruined him. The 2005 trial broke Jackson financially. His entire musical empire, already weakened by more than a decade of unem¬ ployment and overspending, was forced into a series of crippling loan-renegotia¬ tions that were going on until his death. More importantly, that trial broke what¬ ever was left of Jackson's spirit. It was terribly, terribly sad to watch. More so because he had brought almost all of it upon himself.

""Years ago Michael and I were having a deep conversation about life in general,"" she wrote on her internet blog. ""I can't recall the exact subject matter but he may have been ques¬ tioning me about the circumstances of my father's death. He stared at me intensely and he stated with an almost
calm certainty, 'I am afraid that I am going to end up like him, the way he did'."" Presley, 41, who was married to Jack¬ son between 1994 and 1996, added: ""I promptly tried to deter him from the idea, at which point he just shrugged his shoulders and nodded, almost matter of fact, as if to let me know he knew what he knew and that was kind of that."" She said that watching the televi¬ sion of an ambulance leaving the drive¬ way surrounded by crowds brought back memories of the conversation. ""Fourteen years later I am sitting here
watching on the news an ambulance leaving the driveway of his home, the big gates, the crowds outside the gates, the coverage, the crowds outside the hospital, the cause of death and what may have led up to it and the memory of this conversation hit me, as did the unstoppable tears."" TMZ, the celebrity gossip website that broke the news of Jackson's death, reported that his father, Joe, wanted to put his son into a rehab facil¬ ity in California for an addiction to morphine and prescription drugs. Liza Minnelli told The Early Show on CBS by telephone: ""When the

autopsy comes, all hell's going to break loose, so thank God we're cele¬ brating him now."" Uri Geller, who was a friend of Jack¬ son, said: ""I saw Michael do things that I don't like and I screamed and shouted at him. But most ofthe people around him never warned him and did not tell him to stop."" In 2007 Jackson settled a lawsuit filed by a Beverly Hills pharmacy that claimed he owed more than $100,000 for prescription drugs over a two-year period. After Jackson was acquitted on child molestation charges in 2005, the Santa Barbara County District Attor¬ ney Tom Sneddon argued against returning to Jackson some items belonging he described as ""contra¬ band"". Mr Sneddon said that those included syringes, Demerol and pre¬ scriptions for various drugs. However, Jackson's manager de¬ nounced reports that the singer had taken drugs as ""baloney"". Tohme Tohme, a former doctor who acted as his business manager, said: ""Michael Jackson never did any drugs as far as I know. He was healthy. For him to perform he needed insurance. AEG tthe promoter of the London shows] brought in an independent doctor and gave him a four-hour physical. He came out like a rose."" Mr Tohme confirmed that he was at the house when Jackson was suffering cardiac arrest. But he said: ""I came in when he was gone."" He told the New York Post that the doctor who administered to Jackson was Conrad Robert Murray. It is thought that his body will be released to his family after the post¬ mortem examination. No funeral plans have been announced. HM 3CM"

everland was deserted. After crossing a wooden stile, we reached a railway station with an elderly couple sitting on a bench. At first I thought they were real; then I noticed their yellowing, milky eyes, and their dead, waxwork stares. They were waiting an eter¬ nity for a train they would never board. A pink flamingo tiptoed by. I could hear an elephant, then a tiger. It was already clear that Neverland's owner was the victim of a rare and possibly celebrity-induced psychosis. There were waxworks everywhere: more elderly cou¬ ples; a clown holding out a cooler full of ice cream; a grandfather in Dickensian cos¬ tume brandishing a platter of English tof¬ fees. Their faces were all set in the same zombie glare. I began to wonder if there were recording devices in the waxworks' eye sockets. Where had Jackson managed to find all this crap? Above, cameras gleamed in the treetops. A Walt Disney soundtrack played through loudspeakers disguised as rocks. The only real people we could see were Jackson's radio-wired henchmen, buzzing around on the horizon in golf buggies. I felt as if we were on a private island owned by some whacked-out Third World dictator. Perhaps this was all a trap, I thought; per¬ haps we were about to be imprisoned, nip¬ ple-clamped, and forced to listen to Earth Song for the rest of our lives. Adding to the general sense of unease were the statues of children everywhere: some ofthem partly clothed, others com¬ pletely naked. Given Jackson's legal his-
tory, and the fuss over the documentary in which he talked about sleeping with other people's kids, you would have thought he might have replaced them with something less provocative by now -bearded gnomes, perhaps. Then again, Jackson probably thoughtthe Peter Pan themejustified it all. With nothing better to do, we continued our odyssey through Jackson's ranch, eventually reaching the other side. A collec¬ tion of rustic-looking bungalows sat next to a little bridge and a flamingo pond. In one direction was an even larger train terminal (and, I assumed, Jackson's private residence), outside which was a giant outdoor clock, dug into the side ofthe hill. Above was the word ""Neverland"", spelt out in yellow blooms. In the other direction was a paved driveway and the ranch's main entrance, at which stood a pair of huge gold-leafed gates featuring Jackson's fake royal crest and a silhouette of Peter Pan, gazing down from a painted moon. In a nearby bush was another statue ofa naked boy, his little foot raised above a plastic slug. I wondered if Jackson had always been this unhinged, or if it was just fame, mass adulation, an authoritarian father, unlimit¬ ed wealth, and a staff of nodding flunkies that had driven him to it. I once read that Jackson had always loved to shock people, loved to pull stunts and confuse the press or lie to them. But at some point he became the stunt, and by then he'd forgotten how to even pretend to be normal. That's the trick, I suppose - knowing when normal is no longer normal. We were disturbed by clattering metal and the shriek of a whistle. And then, as if from another dimension, a little red steam train appeared. It scared the hell out of me. I didn't even realize we had been standing on train tracks. The train's miniature car¬ riages were all empty. ""All aboard!"" shout¬ ed the conductor, in a sickly tenor. He was some kind of circus midget, and he was dressed like the waxworks in Victorian costume. To another shriek of the whistle, we boarded. The train began to shudder for¬ ward. As the carriages bucked and rattled, we passed the by now familiar sight of more nude children. Then came a stone bridge, a swimming pool, a video-games arcade, another flamingo pond, an Indian village complete with wigwams and a wax¬ work chief, a wooden fort, and then, finally,

a fairground with a Ferris wheel, carousel, dodgems and other rides. Everything looked slightly dilapidated, as though the machines hadn't been oiled or painted since the Eighties, when Jackson was still earning more than he could spend. No doubt some fairground contractor was rip¬ ping him off, along with everyone else. We got off the train near the zoo, petted one of Jackson's elephants for a while, explored a dank outhouse in which a snake the width of tree hissed and squirmed in a filthy tank, then ducked into Neverland's cinema, near a basketball court. There was a glass window in the cinema's lobby, behind which was a wooden model of Jack¬ son moonwalking. It reminded me of a Christmas window display on Fifth Avenue—only a cheap, Chinese-made, im¬ itation. Perhaps Jackson had bought the wooden moonwalking doll from the same place he bought the waxworks. We allowed ourselves to be carried by the swell of the crowd into a marquee, by the merry-go-round. Itwas packed. Young girls were sobbing with joy. Grown men were dancing to Kylie Minogue. The mar¬ quee darkened when the music ended. Lasers swooped. Fake thunder boomed. And then Jackson emerged, Jesus-like, on a steel platform 10ft above the crowd. Was

this as close to him as we were going to get? 1 was struck by his tiny figure; it was that of a teenage girl, not a middle-aged man. He wore a black sequined suit. But no amount of sequins could distract from his terrible, broken face. From somewhere behind his f lame-retardant hairpiece — or perhaps it was real — Jackson squeaked out a thank you and riffed with merciful brevity on the themes of children, hope and the future. Then he hung back as Mike Tyson joined him on the platform and began to cut his birthday cake, lt seemed like as good a time as any to leave. Somewhere out in the gloom of the estate we found a shuttle to take us back to the car park. I sat next to a man in a leather jacket. He said he was Michael's dermatol¬ ogist, and started to tell me all about Bub¬ bles, Jackson's chimpanzee. It turned out that Bubbles had been evicted from Never¬ land after turning inexplicably violent. I knew exactly how the poor chimp felt.

Deborah Haynes Life was never ordinary for Michael Jackson's three children, raised in a world of midnight shopping sprees, Neverland adventures and trips around the world with their eccentric father, who hid them behind veils. His death leaves the ""Jackson Three"" — Prince Michael Joseph Jackson Junior, 12, Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, 11, and Prince Michael II, 7 — in limbo. Their future is expected to be set out in his will, but the stage is set for a three-way custody battle between the Jackson family, Debbie Rowe — Jackson's former wife and mother of the eldest two — and even the children's Rwandan nanny. Family members including Jackson's mother, Katherine, have already of¬ fered to take care of the children following the singer's sudden death. Brian Oxman, the Jackson family lawyer, said last night: ""Probably Mrs Jackson will take care of them, she loves them dearly."" The children have been living with their father and grandmother for the past six months in a rented mansion in Los Angeles. Prince Michael Joseph Jackson Junior and Paris Michael Katherine Jackson were born during the star's second marriage to Ms Rowe. The Aus¬ tralian, who divorced Jackson in 1999, gave up all parental rights after a legal battle. A lawyer yesterday, however, was quoted as saying that these rights were not actually terminated, raising the possibility that she will seek access to her children. In further signs of the potential cus¬ tody struggle, Stacey Brown, a family friend and co-author of a book on
Star's parents, nanny and mother of eldest two may stake claims
Jackson, told ABC News that he had wanted Grace Rwaramba, his child¬ ren's Rwandan nanny, to care for them if anything happened to him. Mystery surrounds the children, con¬ ceived in unusual circumstances. Ob¬ servers question whether Jackson is even the true father, noting the light colour of their skin. The eldest two were born to Ms Rowe, 50, who used to work as a nurse for Jackson's dermatologist before marrying the singer in 1996. The surprise wedding took place in Sydney, Australia, when she was six months pregnant with Prince Michael. The marriage ended soon after the arrival of Paris, who was born in April 1998. Ms Rowe, who lives in Palmdale near Los Angeles, filed for divorce six months later. As part of the settle¬ ment, Jackson said she ""gifted"" him custody of the children. It is unclear whether Rowe will de¬ mand access to her son and daughter. Adding to the intrigue, she told a news¬ paper last year that she conceived both times through artificial insemina¬ tion but refused to give details, fuel¬ ling speculation about paternity. Even less is known about Jackson's youngest son, nicknamed ""Blanket"". Prince Michael II was born in 2002 to an anonymous surrogate mother, apparently after she was fertilised with
Jackson's sperm. Pictures ofthe infant were beamed around the world in. November of that year when Jackson suddenly dangled him, with a blanket over his head, off the balcony of his fourth-floor suite at a Berlin hotel as
hundreds of screaming fans gathered below. The stunt drew widespread criti¬ cism of Jackson and raised concerns about his suitability as a father. The children enjoy star treatment wherever they go, but their lives are
also quite isolated. The three have never attended school, instead being taught at home. Behind closed doors, the girl and her two brothers must feel alone after the death of their father."

Fight over financial
David Brown, Leo Lewis Michael Jackson's complicated finan¬ cial legacy will lead to a battle for control of his business and music empire that could last a decade. Lawyers acting for his family and creditors owed an estimated $500 mil¬ lion (£300 million) will fight for the right to assets of ""Michael Jackson Inc"", which could be valued at more than $1 billion. The singer was reported to have intended to leave his estate to his three children and his mother. Last night it was unclear if that arrange¬ ment was amended later. During his lifetime Jackson was often described as a millionaire who spent like a billionaire. In the years before his death he was clearly strug¬ gling for cash to cover his extravagant spending. ""What he needs more than anything is independence and cash,"" said Diane Diamond, an expert on Jackson, last month. ""His wallet is hurting."" But the singer also made a
number of shrewd investments. In 1985 a financial trust founded by Jackson paid $47.5 million for ATV Music Publishing which owned the Beatles' back catalogue and thousands of other songs. A decade later the trust sold half the company to Sony for $150 million.
His success in the 1980s allowed him to indulge in his wildest fantasies
Sony/ATV Music Publishing now has an estimated value of $2 billion. The $1 billion share owned by the Jackson- created trust is likely to be protected from the singer's creditors. At the time of his death Jackson also had an income estimated at $19 million a year, including $12 mil¬ lion royalties from Sony Music for his back-catalogue. Sony Music is expected to reissue special versions of his biggest-selling albums and possibly
legacy of big-spender who lived in never-never land
previously unreleased recordings — leading to significant increase in royalty payments. The valuable publishing rights for Jackson's own songs are currently controlled by Warner but that deal is due to expire soon and the catalogue folded into Sony/ATV, substantially increasing the value of the company. Fernando Gandioli, an international inheritance expert with Withers lawyers, said that if Jackson has not left a will then under California law his assets would pass to his children, assuming there is no legal wife. If there is a will, Jackson's legacies willl be made public once probate is granted unless he had established a trust during his lifetime. After decades of extravagant spend¬ ing, expensive legal cases and question¬ able business advice, Jackson finally appeared to be attempting sort out his finances. After going through 11 man¬ agers since 1990 he reappointed Frank DiLeo, who had guided him between 1984-1989. Last week he rehired John
Branca, the entertainment lawyer who struck many of his most lucrative deals. Jackson's financial troubles date back to his success in the 1980s, which had allowed him to indulge in his wild¬ est fantasies. He paid $19.5 million on the Neverland ranch at Santa Barbara, California, turning its 2,600 acres into an estate with its own zoo, amusement park and miniature. railway. At one time the estate had a staff of 150 with an estimated wage bill of $10 million. But even as the hits dried up he con¬ tinued to spend, with outgoings between $20 million and $30 million a year more than his income. He was an obsessive shopper and collector, spending $4 million in a single spree at one Las Vegas emporium in 2003, including a giant marble chess set and 10ft tall glass urns. Then there was a series of highly damaging and expensive legal settle¬ ments. In 1994 he was reported to have agreed a £16.5 million out-of- court deal with family of Jordan
Chandler over abuse allegations. Five years layer he paid £5 million to Debbie Rowe in return for residency rights of their two children in a divorce settlement. In 2004 he paid £1.1 million to the son of an employee at Neverland ranch who accused him of abuse. By the time of his 2005 trial for child abuse he had debts of $300 million. He obtained a $91 mil¬ lion loan from Bank of America, later increased to £166 million. In 2008 the debt had risen to £178 million. When he defaulted on the loan to the tune of £198,000 the debt was sold to Fortress Investment Group, a hedge fund. Jackson's finan¬ cial troubles were highlighted again when he defaulted on £24.5 million debt secured on Neverland in spring last year. Six months later he was sued for £4.7 million in London by his former benefactor, Sheikh Abdulla bin Hamad al-Khalifa, who had initially lent him £23,000 to pay his utility bills for Neverland. Although the case was
settled out of court, there are still a number of outstanding legal cases, including the singer's former spokes¬ man, who is seeking a $59 million settlement. But Jackson still owned half of Nev¬ erland, which is currently being refur¬ bished in partnership with the real estate firm Colony Capital LLC, and has been valued at up to $80 million. Tom Barrac, chief executive of Colony Capital, said: ""You are talking about a guy who could make $500 mil¬ lion a year if he put his mind to it. There are very few artists who are muiltibillion-dollar businesses, And he is one."" As lawyers began poring over the finances there was one final bizzare twist with a claim that Sir Paul McCartney could be one ofthe benefi¬ ciaries amid unconfirmed reports that he had been left Jackson's share ofthe Beatles' back catalogue. All this should give a plethora of lawyers plenty to fight over — and their bills will run into many millions.

Industry experts were predicting yesterday that a new benchmark would be set for pop music, 27 years on from the commercial peak that Jackson scaled with Thriller. The singer also looked likely last night to claim the top spot on Sunday's UK album chart thanks to a surge of emotionally charged

purchases online and in the high street. His unreleased and unnamed album was produced with hip hop and R'n'B songwriting talents including Akon, Ne-Yo, and Will.I.Am, of the Black Eyed Peas. Jackson was said to be nervous about the public's reaction. Describing the material before Jack¬ son's death, Akon told Entertainment Week: ""It's incredible. We're trying something he's never done before, and that's the challenge. There's not too much Michael Jackson hasn't covered. Just be ready for it."" It would be an unusual but far from unprecedented achievement for an
artist top the chart so late in the week. Five albums in the past five years have entered the charts at Nol with a Friday release, most recently 21st Century Breakdown by Green Day last month. Yesterday eight of the top ten bestselling albums on iTunes, the leading download site, were Jackson records, with the 2003 compilation album Number Ones headingthe chart. On amazon.co.uk Jackson had the top 14 albums, with a special-edition reissue of Off the Wall in first place. Jackson's singles have not yet had a similar impact but that is expected to change this weekend. The momentum behind Jackson can only build as blan¬ ket media coverage of his life and legacy continues, retailers said. Music shops around the country were urgently restocking Jackson material yesterday. HMV reported that its online store was ""completely cleaned out by pre-orders overnight"". A spokesman said: ""By next week¬ end I think he will be dominating both the singles and the album charts and • may well be topping both of them."" Now that digital downloads are included in the chart, every available song in an artist's back catalogue is a potential hit single at any time. HMV said that after a long period in the relative commercial doldrums, Jack¬ son could be on the threshold of a unique chart achievement. ""The common view was that the first time that an artist claimed the whole of the Top Ten would be when the Beatles released their songs for download. Now suddenly it could be

""There's a huge younger generation out there that hasn't really got most of his output and they are going to be big buyers over the next few weeks.""

rash of boxed sets and tributes. It happened to Elvis Presley, John Len¬ non and Frank Sinatra. Alice Lamboi, 21, a tearful student who bought Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad at HMV in Oxford Street, London, yesterday, said: ""I just can't believe he's dead. I've loved him for as long as I can remember. I used to own
these albums but my brother destroyed them, so when I heard the news today it felt like the right time to get them back as a tribute to him. ""I was all set to see him at the O2 in February, but I'm not going to ask for a refund — itjust wouldn't seem right. I'll just keep the tickets in his memory."""

'HE WAS A GENIUS IN THE ART
Michael Jackson will now become oneof the fixed stars in the galaxy of popular culture
BENOKRl
very now and again a meteor streaks across our collective H consciousness bringing unexpected blessings. And this little child from a steel town in the United States, who appeared in our world with a piercing voice and who achieved an almost blasphemous level of fame, might prove to be more than just a meteor. Michael Jackson managed the rare feat of being not only a child prodigy of popular music but also becoming a modern master. To achieve classical stature is rare in any genre. He made some ofthe most distinctive, memorable and feet-intoxicating music of our times. As an entertainer he was a genius, marrying innovation in dance, brilliance in presentation and an extraordinary feel for the pulse of the time. He was also a genius in the art of fame. For he managed to make his voice and his face so much part of our popular culture and so much part ofthe parallel of our lives that he is as intimate to us as someone we have known for as long as we can remember. But in the midst ofall ofthis it is possible to miss the peculiar sweetness of his spirit. He came across as one ofthe gentlest, most sensitive and fragile of performers, and it is a testimony to the profound sweetness of him that he endured such monumental calumny and the persistent monstrosities of fame and still managed to radiate an essential kindness. He came
he f
across as someone almost cursed by too much good fortune. And there was often an air about him ofan intolerable paradoxical loneliness. His effect on people was almost unnatural. The Beatles at their best could sway huge crowds with great emotion but there were four ofthem. Michael Jackson could send a deep gasp, a frisson through a crowd of tens of thousands with just a discernible movement of his shoulder. His public appearances created hysteria. When he descended oh cities, it had the effect of that strange power attributed to Pan in the mountains, a mixture of panic and ecstasy seizing the multitudes. There were times when that fame bordered on the numinous. Was it a combination of his music, which had entered into almost every soul, with the increasing demonisation of his appearance by the mass media, combined with a kind of elfin beauty that radiated from him in almost inhuman confidence. We live in a world of uncertainties. We struggle with our anonymity. We are beset by fears and problems and we secretly long for something that would hint at some shining indestructible glory within. Maybe that is what the rare superstars do. They are absorbent of our desire for a living image of immortality. Elvis Presley did that. And not even his death diminished that magnetism. Michael Jackson, magically transcending race and colour and nationality, did that. And in an odd way his death came at a fortunate cusp. He left in the midst of intense expectation. Reborn again in the hopes of his big comeback, not long after his redemption by being acquitted ofall the charges against him, he leaves in a space of abundant potential. Maybe the most difficult thing is to achieve that monumental glory a second time. On the whole it is not given to mortals. To achieve it once as he did with the world conquest of Thriller is astonishing by the highest standards of his industry. Only death atthe right time can balance out the turbulent books ofall the strange repercussions of such success. Allen Ginsberg said ofthe Beatles that they were angels sent down to cheer the world up with music. MichaelJackson was also one such angel. Now he will join the fixed stars in the firmament of popular culture. Now we can appreciate his beauty and his song. ©Ben Okri, 2009

Glastonbury Festival Worthy Farm, Pilton • •••<&
From several of the public address systems that scattered the crowded thoroughfares, an almighty sound collage of Michael Jackson songs permeated the muggy air. The self-styled King of Pop may not, in his lifetime, have had any awareness of this king of rock festivals. But his death had an unlikely effect on it. For the first time in recent history, the heavens opened and, actually, no one seemed too bothered. One member of the group Friendly Fires was overheard uttering that, ""even as we speak, ropey versions of Michael Jackson songs are being hastily rehearsed"" — although perhaps mercifully, their thrillingly exuberant display at the Other Stage steered clear of mawkish tributes. More than most, the American funk-rockers N.E.R.D. had reason to acknowledge his passing on stage. A few years ago, their producer- frontman, Pharrell Williams, was scheduled to produce a credible comeback album for Jackson, but the singer pulled out at the last minute, clearing the way for Williams to help
to launch Justin Timberlake's career. However, but for a cursory, ""God bless Michael Jackson"" the news went unmarked during the group's mid-afternoon set. While saying nothing about Jackson's passing, Lily Allen accessorised in his name, thoughtfully donning a single white glove in his memory. Having been to countless Glastonburys throughout her life, Allen knows exactly what's required.

In one of the stand-out sets of Glastonbury 2009, the No 1 popstar managed to make a sunny field in Somerset feel like a scuzzy gay New York nightclub — combining cabaret, pop and disco in a manner which resulted in her playing a bluesy, ragtime version of Pokerface while almost wholly naked,
standing on a piano stool, on one leg to awestruck applause. Back over at the Pyramid Stage, it was the reformed Specials who turned in the first mass singalong. Fans who had not been born when A Message To You Rudy came out were word perfect. And as the setting Sun illuminated Worthy Farm, Michael Eavis beamed along with it. In past years, volume restrictions have proved to be the undoing of many a Glastonbury headliner. One imagines Neil Young was bound by the same restrictions, but, at 63, he has a few tricks up his sleeve. Beneath a crescent moon in a cloudless sky, the hills almost shook as he navigated his band through a monolithically huge version of Words (Between the Lines of Age). Somewhere in the centre of the human sea you could make out a flag with the title of Hey Hey My My waving with frantic excitement as Young shook out its opening chords. Everyone else merely waved any limbs they had available to them. ""Hey hey, my my/Rock'n'roll will never die,"" intoned Young's marvellously grizzled timbre. Aided by several thousand voices, the sentiments on which Glastonbury was predicated resounded gloriously into the night air."

JONATHAN MARGOLIS
MICHAEL JACKSCN 1958-2009
f there was one thing that Michael Jackson hated, despised and obsessed about, itwas the soubriquet Wacko Jacko, invented, rather cleverly I always thought, by a Sun sub-editor after the performer was photographed lying down in a prema¬ ture baby's oxygen tent. He insisted to me that he wasn't remotely ""wacko"" again and again during a bizarre time a decade ago when I worked alongside him for almost a year, writing a doomed, subsequently unpublished, book on, er, the sanctity of childhood. Michael's explanation for the episode was compelling to anyone who knows the ways of the popular end of press photo¬ graphy. And it didn't give me a lot of scope for defending the Sun headline writer. The incident, in Michael's view, stemmed from ajoke that he cracked to a photographer. He had been opening a wing ofa children's hospital in LA and spot¬ ted the respirator. ""Gee, if I had one of those, I could live to be 150,"" he claims that he said. The snapper then coaxed him into the machine on the pretext that it would be great publicity for the hospital, fired off a few frames and gave birth to a myth about Michael actually
k 8 1
owning and sleeping in such an appliance. Well, this could be true or it could be a desperate invention, and the person who would have known least what it was, in my view, was Michael himself. Some of his associates and, more telling¬ ly, former associates regarded Michael as an inveterate liar. He never told me any¬ thing I could precisely prove was a fib, but his relationship with what a normal person would call the truth was tenuous. Take the facial plastic surgery thing. Despite it faking Michael an hour every morning to ""fix himself up"" as he put it, he coyly denied having had ""work done"". I ex¬ cused that as so much Hollywood shtick; what star ever does confess it? Yet Michael would then segue straight into talking about his appearance and what I am sure was the real, unaffected man was at last re¬ vealed. In this mode, he morphed from being a charming, amusing and often enchanting flake into a serious, mature, tortured man, whom I believe was being wholly honest. He told the late Jackie Onassis, who helped him with his autobiography, Moon-
walker, that he used to wear masks to hide, and told me that his father, the famously harsh and demanding Joseph Jackson, bullied him as a child, repeatedly telling the little boy he was ugly, fat and spotty. This must have been a pretty scarring inheritance. When I caught a surreptitious glimpse of Michael eyeing himself in a hotel bathroom mirror — his actual levee, although as complicated seemingly as Louis XIV's, was attended only by his child¬ hood friend and manager Frank Tyson—I was minded ofan anorexic teenager who is never quite satisfied with the image he sees in the mirror and has to keep changing it. Establishing what was truly reliable was nonetheless difficult with Michael, like him hugely as I did during our acquaint¬ ance. Often, 1 think he was at a loss to remember stuff about his own life. Who can recall accurately anything before the teenage years? Almost nobody, yet a signifi¬ cant part of Michael's career took place in the indistinct, muddled fog of childhood. Often, then, Michael's memory of far-off times was either inaccurate or built up in retrospect.
When it came to Michael's trial in the Santa Monica court house, of course, the dodgy memories (and, perhaps, financially motivated inventions) of children again became important — and might yet have ensured that Michael's tragic death took place in a federal penitentiary. I am confident he was truthful when he insisted he was no child molester. This is partly because Michael's strict religious background—he was a Jehovah's Witness although he flirted with Judaism and, latterly, Islam — ensured that even if his slightly ambiguous sexuality urged him to molest, his personal morality would have made such behaviour wholly impossible for him. More to the point, no social worker or child protection expert I ever spoke to or heard believed that he fitted anything like the classic profile of an abuser. Almost all paedophiles, as I understand it, are serial offenders with dozens or hun¬ dreds of victims. Michael, through his love of children and the small matter of having a free funfair in his back garden, was in con¬ tact with tens of thousands of children every year. Where was their testimony when the district attorney wanted it? Or will it all come out only now? Another mystery. I remain swayed by the theory that Michael was a genuinely childlike individual, with an emotional age of about 14, this the result of having had one ofthe weirdest upbringings in history —a combination of being an international star from the age of 5, having a violent and abusive father, and being brought up in a sweet-natured but lunatic religious sect. In other words, Michael's sexual develop¬ ment may have progressed no farther than the childish and ultimately harmless ""you show me yours and I'll show you mine"" stage. Yet how, I can't help wondering, did his childlike nature square with his consider¬ able maturity in business? Sure, he spent his money like a 12-year-old with an Amex card in Hamleys, but in earning that cash mountain, generations of record company executives will attest that he was some¬ thing of a boardroom shark, with a meticu¬ lous eye for balance-sheet detail and a merciless way of dealing with incompe¬ tence or fiscal treachery. I suppose these two Michaels could have co-existed, but it is odd, isn't it, suggesting that the childlikeness could be a pose, a manipulative front he put on to lure vulner¬ able children into his traps? Everyone who knew him sometimes questioned Michael Jackson's relationship with the truth; yet with, in effect, a cash prize on offer after the massive deal with Jordan Chandler for anyone able halfway convincingly to allege abuse, there were barely any applicants. Surely one would have expected a queue of chancers all the way from Neverland to Los Angeles trying to ring up three cherries on the Jackson fruit machine? Yet the families who took their cases to court weren't even convincing enough to sway a sceptical, verging on hostile, jury in a city and a country that had long since fallen badly out of love with Michael. It must count as a tribute to Michael's credibility that the case against him failed so unexpectedly."

It was a day that showed both the power and frailty of the medium. A celebrity news site, TMZ.com, secured the scoop of a lifetime when it was first to report that Jackson had died — but the site then crashed several times, unable to cope with millions of visitors flooding to it. Other websites did not fare much better. Google believed it was under attack when the news first broke. For 35 minutes, millions of people who
googled Jackson's name were greeted with an error page rather than a list of results. Google said that there had been a ""volcanic"" surge in interest in Michael Jackson, with most of the top 100 searches related to the singer. All Facebook, which tracks Face- book usage, reported that Jackson's page was attracting about 20 fans a second, and fast becoming one of the top pages in all of Facebook. Perez Hilton's gossip blog also broke down under the weight of people rushing to the site, and the micro-blogging service Twitter shut down temporarily after receiving hundreds of thousands of tweets, ""This particular news about the pass- ing of such a global icon is the biggest jump in tweets per second since the
US presidential election,"" Biz Stone, Twitter's co-founder, said. Internet analysts said that, at its peak^ roughly 15 per cent of au posts on Twitter mentioned Michael Jack- son. That compares with less than 5 per cent for Iran's disputed elections and the swine flu pandemic. Celebri- ties such as Demi Moore and P Diddy used Twitter to offer their personal tributes, but the Foreign Office denied that David Miliband was among those to do the same. A tweet reading ""Never has one soared so high yet dived so low"" was attributed to the For- eign Secretary, but his office said that the account was a fake. Blogs and social media sites have grown in influence and importance in the decade since the news aggregation
site Drudge Report broke the story of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and, while Thursday's events were partly a tale of the tradi¬ tional news media playing catch-up with the internet, they also showed how the established players have finally worked out how to tap into the power of the web. TMZ.com is owned by the internet giant AOL, itself an arm of Time Warner, the multibillion- dollar media conglomerate that runs the TV news channel CNN. Traditional news outlets such as the BBC and Sky News were cautious in following TMZ.com, but told audien¬ ces that the website had a history of correctly reporting such stories — it was the first to reveal that the actor Heath Ledger had died."

Jerry Macon was the first audience that Michael Jackson ever had. Jerry's mother, Leola, was best friends with Michael's mother Kather¬ ine, or Kate, from the Jehovah's Wit¬ nesses church. The Macons would go and watch the Jackson boys perform in their tiny living room — before Michael Jackson even began to sing. ""Me and my mother used to go over to their house and we used to watch them practise,"" Mr Macon told The Times. ""I remember when they first started practising, he used to play the bongos. I knew he was going to be somebody because of the way he would play them bongos and just get up and start dancing. To me, it just seemed like he had more talent than his brothers."" Mr Macon, 53, is now a pistol-pack¬ ing appliance repairman in the ""Rust Belt"" town of Gary, Indiana, once dubbed ""the Murder Capital of Amer¬ ica"". He still lives just blocks from the rickety white bungalow where Kate and Joseph Jackson, a crane driver at a steel mill, raised their nine children. Jackson's death has undammed a flood of nostalgia for better times in the steel town just outside Chicago, now full of abandoned buildings and ravaged by drugs and crime. Residents have left dozens of teddy- bears in front of the Jacksons' old home — a ritual copied, some say, from the makeshift memorials to local murder victims. Jackson's old block has become a street party, with fans dressing up as the King of Pop and moonwalking to Thriller. Jackson was a micro-star in Gary long before he became a superstar else¬ where. The Jackson 5 performed at clubs, school dances and even busked in their backyard. ""We would see him dancing on the corner,"" recalled Cynthia Addison, 60, who lives near the Jacksons' old home at 2300 Jackson Street (named after President Andrew Jackson). The Jackson 5 were soon playing as the opening act at local venues like Club 007 and at school ""sock-hops"". ""We had 'sock-hops'. You would take off your shoes and dance in the gymnasium. The Jacksons used to play. Michael was very talented,"" Sarah Ligon, 50, said. ""Everybody around loved them,"" she said. ""It was a time when all of our parents worked at the steel mills and you could walk the streets and leave your door open."" Leola Macon, now 78, said: ""Kate and Joe were good parents. What I was hearing about Joe being a hard- driver, well, hejust wanted them to be successful — and he succeeded. ""Michael was a great little boy — very manner-able and somewhat shy. He always had a good voice, but I did not think too much of it. I did not ever think they would become famous. They started playing instruments, and I said, 'Wait a minute. You all are getting down!'"" Mr Macon said: ""I remember when I was in the 4th grade and the Jackson 5 were performing at our school, it cost 25 cents to get in and see them. I even remember what they had on — black pants, white shirts and a red cummerbund around the waist, all of them."" He said that Mrs Jackson kept the family home spotless, even though she struggled to feed her nine children. ""Every now and then Michael's mother would fix dinnertor the family and I would be over there,"" he said.
""The last meal I ate was black-eyed peas and corn bread. They did not have no meat. But we had ice cream for dessert."" The Jacksons left Gary after the Jackson 5 recorded their first album — Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5 — in 1969, when Michael was 11. But Rudy Clay, the mayor, wants Jackson to be buried in Gary ahd hopes to transform his modest former home into a museum, even if it means
moving it away from the nearby crack- houses to a more accessible locale. ""If they can do it for Elvis Presley in Graceland, we can do it for Michael Jackson in Gary,"" Mr Clay said. Mrs Macon calls Michael Jackson's death ""pitiful"" but said it did not come as a surprise. ""Somehow I was looking for it. I did not think he took too much care of himself. The music did not harm him. What I think harmed Michael was the fame and money.""

Police continued to investigate the sudden death of Michael Jackson yes¬ terday as his family gathered to decide plans for the star's funeral. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician and the last man to see him alive, was interviewed by homicide detectives for three hours on Saturday evening. Dr Murray, a cardiologist, was living at Jackson's rented man¬ sion in Los Angeles when the singer suffered a cardiac arrest. The doctor tried to resuscitate him and went with him to the hospital where Jackson was pronounced dead. Police had spoken to him briefly after the death but were looking for him all day on Friday. Miranda Sevcik, a spokeswoman for the doctor, said that Dr Murray ""helped identify the circumstances around the death of the pop icon and clarified some inconsistencies"". Police towed Dr Murray's car from Jackson's home hours after the singer died and said later that it could contain medica¬ tions or other evidence. Detectives said Dr Murray had ""pro¬ vided information which will aid the
investigation"". He is not a suspect in the inquiry, which is being carried out on behalf of the LA County Coroner's Office. Friends, family and members of Jackson's large entourage all face fur¬ ther interviews to establish the precise events leading up to the death. The Jackson family also asked for a second, private autopsy because of un¬ answered questions about how he died, and the celebrity website TMZ — which broke news of the star's death — said that this had been carried out. The body is thought to be at a private mortuary after the coroner's office released it to the family late on Friday. Jackson was said to have been ad¬ dicted to a cocktail of prescription drugs, including painkillers, and the
family wants to investigate claims that he was given an injection ofthe power¬ ful painkiller Demerol immediately before his death. Last night Dr Murray denied that he administered the drug to the singer. Edward Chernoff, a lawyer acting for Dr Murray, said: ""Dr Murray has never prescribed nor administered Demerol to Michael Jackson. Not ever. Not that day. Not OxyContin [either] for that matter."" Mr Chernoff also discussed how his client found the dying Jackson. ""He just happened to find him in his bed and he wasn't breathing. Mr Jackson was still warm and had a pulse."" Coroner's officials have said that Jackson was taking prescription medi¬ cines, but declined to elaborate. Preliminaiy results from an autopsy by Los Angeles County medical examiners showed no sign of foul play. No official cause of death was given, but one is expected after the results of toxicology tests within six weeks. The Rev Jesse Jackson, a family friend, said: ""It's abnormal. We don't know what happened. Was he inject¬ ed, and with what? All reasonable doubt should be addressed."" More speculation about the cause of death — and Jackson's lifestyle — was aroused when Grace Rwaramba, 42, nanny to Jackson's three children, told The Sunday Times how she regularly had to pump Jackson's stomach to re¬ move dangerous cocktails of drugs. Ms Rwaramba, who was dismissed six months ago, flew from London to Los Angeles in the hope of seeing the children. She said: ""I had to pump his stomach many times. He always mixed so much of it."" The family, including most of Jack¬ son's siblings, have gathered at the family compound in Encino, Califor¬ nia. The Jackson- family patriarch Joseph said in a statement: ""In one of the darkest moments of our lives we find it hard to find the words appropri¬ ate to this sudden tragedy we all had to encounter. ""Our beloved son, brother and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly, in such a tragic way and much too soon. It leaves us, his family, speechless and devastated to a point where communication with the out¬ side world seems almost impossible."" Mr Jackson also added that the singer's three children — Michael Joseph, 12, known as Prince; Paris Michael Katherine, 11; and their sev¬ en-year-old brother Prince Michael II, known as Blanket — were also touched by the support from fans worldwide. President Obama has written pri¬ vately to Jackson's family expressing his condolence, David Axelrod, a White House adviser, said.

Leo Lewis He conquered the pop world and created sales records that could remain unchallenged, but Michael Jackson may have another number one position waiting for him: the highest-earning dead celebrity. The annual Forbes magazine list of big earners that are deceased tells the story of death's ability to boost a brand. Bob Marley, Kurt Cobain, Johnny Cash and Tupac Shakur are all on it, each making millions every year, and in some cases more than living singers such as Madonna. For the past two years, Elvis Presley has held the top position with annual earnings of about $50 million (£30.3 million). If the Neverland Ranch is opened to the public and the current frenzy for his music continues, Jackson could find his earnings hitting twice those of Presley. The figure

could be even higher if, along with the untangling of his finances and some clever management, a rumoured album of unreleased songs emerges quickly enough for sales to be driven by what some music industry figures are referring to as ""grief momentum"". The commercial force of Jackson- inspired grief and nostalgia has already started to show. Radio stations across Europe began playing back-to- back songs from the Thriller album after being inundated with requests. Tokyo's largest music stores sold out of his music. Amazon.com's online sales ofhis tunes in America were run¬ ning at about 700 times the usual rate. Beyond their success while alive and widespread international fan base, the King of Pop and the King of Rock 'n' Roll have plenty in common now they have gone. Often, when the star's eccentricities and spending habits are removed from the equation, the estate
can get on with the more serious business of milking the cash cow that is left behind. The posthumous earnings of Pres¬ ley also provide a useful guide for those who are looking to maximise the selling power of Jackson. Presley died with an estate that was worth less than $5 million. It was only when the assets — the music, the ubi¬ quitous and lucrative image and the Graceland mansion — were run more aggressively and industrially that the money began to roll in. A few years
after death
ago the main share of the estate and the lease on Graceland were sold for $100 million. For many years, the management ofthe Presley image was slow and unimaginative. Recent deals with Cirque du Soleil and efforts to squeeze tourist value from Graceland suggest a more assertive approach. Bob Marley is another good example of how death can boost a brand. When he died in 1981, Marley's royalty earnings were $200,000 a year. Since then they have consis¬ tently been more than $3 million. Other entrants on the dead musicians' list demonstrate the many oddities and one-off settlements that can affect annual earnings. Marvin Gaye returned to the list because of the 50th anniversary of Motown Records and the re-release of various songs. A 2004 cinema biopic of Ray Charles had a similar, if short-lived, effect on his annual earnings.

Lawyers for the family went to court to assert the right of Jackson's mother, Katherine, to take care of 12-year-old
Michael Joseph Jackson Jr — known as Prince Michael — Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, 11, and Prince Michael II, 7. Mitchell Beckloff, a judge in the Los Angeles Superior Court, granted temporary guardianship to Mrs Jack¬ son, who has been looking after the
children at the family compound since her son's death last Thursday. The family moved to seize control of other elements of the Michael Jackson legacy. They announced that they had sole ""personal and legal authority"" to act on behalf of their son and appointed Londell McMillan, an
entertainment lawyer, as the family's designated spokesman. Jackson's parents also asked for Katherine to be named as administra¬ tor of her late son's estate. The court documents state that she intends to use her late son's assets exclusively for his three children ""after payment of debts and expenses of administration"". Mr McMillan said that the family had not heard from Deborah Rowe, the mother of Jackson's two older children. The youngest son was born to an unknown surrogate mother. If Ms Rowe were given residency rights, it would be ""detrimental"" to the child¬ ren, court papers claimed. ""I don't think there will be anybody who thinks that there is someone better [than Katherine Jackson to have custody]"", Mr McMillan said.on the NBC Today show. ""She is a very loving host of other grandchildren."" Frank DiLeo, Jackson's manager,
said that a will made by the singer was due to be opened yesterday and that it contained financial provisions for the children and his wishes for his child¬ ren. He said he did not know when the will was made but added that it was ""more than likely"" that it would be Katherine Jackson who was named as legal guardian ""because Michael was extremely, extremely close to her"". Judge Beckloff set a hearing for July 6. The children will not have to be present, a court spokesman said. Jackson jealously guarded his children's privacy, making them wear masks in public, but a picture of them emerged yesterday from Raymone Bain, Jackson's former publicist and general manager. ""Those kids knew three and four languages — even the little one. They were well mannered and sweet. I can't imagine these child¬ ren without him,"" he said. The Rev Jesse Jackson, a family friend, said he saw the three children over the weekend, playing with their cousins at the family home. Ms Rowe, a former nurse for Jack¬ son's dermatologist, married the star in 1996 but filed for divorce in 1999. She gave up her rights to the children in 2001 but two years later petitioned to have those rights restored after Jackson was arrested on child molesta¬ tion charges, and an appeal court sided with her. Jackson and Ms Rowe apparently reached a financial settle¬ ment in 2006 but the terms have never been officially disclosed. The Los Angeles coroner's office dismissed a report claiming that its autopsy found that Jackson was emaci¬ ated and almost bald when he died. ""It is not accurate. Some of it is totally false,"" said Ed Winter, the assistant chief coroner. The office says that it needs to complete toxicology tests, expected to take four to six weeks, before it can state the cause of death. Joe Jackson, the singer's father, said last night that the funeral arrange¬ ments would not be finalised until the results were known from a second post-mortem examination that the family requested. He told ABC7: ""Michael was dead before he left the

The Jackson family has questioned the role of the singer's physician, Conrad Murray, who was with him when he collapsed. Lawyers for Dr Murray, who had been treating Jackson for three years and who had recently moved into the rented man¬ sion, issued a categorical denial yester¬ day that the doctor had administered an injection of Demerol, a narcotic painkiller, to Jackson before his death. The family is said to be considering a series of simultaneous memorial services around the world for Jackson, an event that could dwarf even the send-off given to Elvis Presley in 1977.

Famous for their feuds almost as much as their music, the fault lines within the Jackson family are under renewed strain from the star's death (Matt Spence writes). The clan has a long, bitter record of public spats, financial battles and abuse allegations. Much of the bad blood originates from Joe Jackson, the father whose pursuit of success through the musical talents of his children was often ruthless and brutal. In interviews Michael described his father's iron-fisted methods, saying that Joe would sit in a chair with a belt in his hand while the children rehearsed and ""if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up"". Marlon, the older brother, later recalled an episode where their father held Michael upside down by one leg and beat him repeatedly with his hand. Other allegations of abuse followed from LaToya and Janet Jackson, and Joe himself admitted in a BBC interview in 1993 that he whipped his children with a belt as they grew up. Michael and Janet's success dwarfed that of their siblings, leading to their closeness and suspicions of jealousy among the others. One of the most public spats was over LaToya's marriage to a small-time criminal, Jack Gordon, which drove a wedge between her and the entire family. At the BET Awards show on Sunday, Joseph Jackson said: ""It's been really tough. Remember we just lost the biggest superstar in the world."" Perhaps that sentiment was the source of all the family's troubles. Joe lost a ""superstar"" and not a son."

Michael Jackson fans who bought tickets for the 50 planned London shows will be given a full refund, or the chance to keep the ticket as a souvenir. Tickets have yet to be sent out, but AEG Live, the promoters, have asked buyers to contact them to choose either a refund or to get their ticket. The company says the tickets were designed by Jackson himself. Randy Phillips, chief executive of AEG Live, said: ""The world lost a
kind soul who just happened to be the greatest entertainer the world has ever known. Since he loved his fans in life, it is incumbent upon us to treat them with the same rever¬ ence and respect after his death."" Seatwave and Viagogo, both ticket exchange websites, said last week that they would refund ticket holders. Although the AEG refunds are only available to fans who pur¬ chased them through authorised agents, other sellers, including eBay and PayPal, have pledged to return payments. EBay said it will return sales commission to sellers."

Simon Fox, chief executive of HMV, said that sales of Jackson's albums have multiplied by 80 since the singer's death last Thursday. During his lifetime Jackson sold more than 750 million records. The music retailer, which had stocked up on Jackson's albums in anticipation of a series of concerts due to take place at the O2 arena in East London, sold out of CDs on Saturday and is awaiting new stock from Sony. HMV said that the most popular album is the compilation Number Ones, followed by the 1983 album Thriller, described by many as the pop starts masterpiece and the bestselling album ofall time. Third is King of Pop, released to commemorate Jackson's
50th birthday last August, followed by Off the Wall, his first solo album. Man in the Mirror, the 1988 single in which the singer urges listeners to ""take a look at themselves and make a change"", is the most downloaded single at hmv.com. Jackson was due to perform 50 This Is It farewell concerts at the O2 arena, starting this month. AEG Live, the promoters, are understood to be facing a £7300 million loss after being unable to insure about 30 of them. Randy Phillips, the president of AEG, said in an interview with Sky News that he was hoping that the other members of the Jackson 5 could perform. The Jackson family have not commented on the proposal. Mr Phillips also said that footage of Jackson's rehearsals for the shows may be released. Tickets for the concerts sold at a rate of 11 per second, with face prices of £50 to £75. Fans have been offered refunds or souvenir tickets."

Not only has the death of Michael Jackson given an extraordinary boost to its CD sales. The demise of rivals such as Woolworths and Zawi has enabled HMV to hoover up some of their market share. But it was also thanks to HMV's efforts to wean itself off CDs that it managed to push profits up by 12 per cent to £63 million. As the industry continued to lose sales to digital formats and file-sharing websites, it decided that merely setting up shop online would not be enough. Instead, it is trying to redefine itself as an entertainment company that goes beyond traditional retailing. A joint venture with MAMA, Britain's second-largest concert venue owner, this year took it into live music. The record shop of old would have sold you the album: now HMV hopes to sell you the ticket, the tour DVD and the T-shirt for good measure. It has opened a cinema in a former stock room above one of its stores and is considering more, while it has also introduced mobile phone entertainment concessions with Orange, the mobile operator, in recognition of the increasing importance of phones for entertainment. It is bolstering its gaming offer by introducing ""pay-to-play"" sections in a handful of stores. None of this is financially significant — not yet, anyway — but at least it appears that HMV is alive to the implications of a rapidly changing market. Some of its rivals never were, which is probably why they died."

Mike Harvey Los Angeles Thousands of mourning fans will besiege Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch on Friday after his family announced plans for a public wake. The family will hold a private memo¬ rial service at the 2,500-acre estate in Santa Barbara County, California, on Sunday. Plans for Jackson's funeral remain unclear. At its height, Neverland featured its own amusement park, a zoo with giraffes and tigers and statues of child¬ ren at play. He left the estate after his acquittal on charges in 2005 that he molested a 13-year-old boy there. Thomas J Barrack Jr, the Los Ange¬ les billionaire whose firm owns a majority stake in Neverland, issued an open letter to the Santa Barbara com¬ munity urging them to welcome Jack¬ son fans. Many objected to hordes who arrived in 2005 during Jackson's most recent child abuse trial. Mr Bar¬ rack took control of Neverland in No¬ vember as Jackson faced foreclosure. Jackson left the estate to his child¬ ren, his mother and children's chari¬ ties, according to reports. The pop star left nothing to his father, Joe, whom he accused of abusing him as a child. The existence of a will, drafted by Jackson in 2002, has emerged as his parents swiftly moved to take control of his assets in court. The Wall Street Journal reported that Jackson's former lawyer, John Branca, wrote the will and he could file it to the probate court this week. Mr Branca is named as an executor, as is the music executive John McClain. The news will complicate the
looming court battle over the assets. His parents have asked a judge to make Katherine Jackson, the star's mother, administrator of his estate. The family want to take charge ofhis debt-ridden but potentially lucrative fi¬ nancial empire and act as permanent caretakers of his three children. In documents filed in the Superior Court in Los Angeles, Jackson's parents said they believed that their 50-year-old son died without a valid will. In the documents Burt Levitch, an attorney for Mrs Jackson, stated that others hold documents, including a will, that could work ""to the detriment ofthe estate"". Jackson claimed to have a net worth of $236 million (£143 mil¬ lion) in 2007, according to documents obtained by the Associated Press. Jackson had $567.6 million in assets, including Neverland, his share of the Sony/ATV Music Publishing cata¬ logue, which includes the rights to songs by the Beatles, and an assort¬ ment of cars and antiques, according to a statement of financial condition by the accounting firm Thompson, Cobb, Bazilio & Associates. The report says that Jackson had debts of $331 million, leaving him with a net worth of $236.6 million. He had just $668,215 in cash, according to the report, which is dated June 12, 2007. A judge granted Mrs Jackson, 79, temporary guardianship of Michael Joseph Jackson Jr, known as Prince Michael, 12, Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, 11, and Prince Michael II, 7. Court papers state that she intends to use her late son's assets exclusively for his children ""after payment of debts and expenses of administration"". The judge also granted Mrs Jackson the right to take control of her son's personal property. The judge did not immediately rule on her requests to take charge of the children's and Jackson's estates. A hearing is scheduled for Monday. Investigators have retrieved medica¬ tion from the rented mansion where the star collapsed last week. Coroner's investigators and police detectives
spent hours in the house and emerged with two bags filled with evidence. The coroner's office performed a post-mortem examination on Friday but deferred a finding on the cause of death, ordering toxicology tests. A second, private post-mortem has been requested by the family.

Pop culture won
Daniel Finkelstein
When the toothy teen band the Osmonds reached No 1 with their first hit, One Bad Apple, Joe Jackson was furious. The father of the Jackson boys believed that Michael and his brothers should have had that song. Jackson attacked Berry Gordy, the Motown founder, in bitter terms. ""He handed those white boys a song we should have recorded,"" he wildly alleged. ""And Mormons too!"" From his earliest days, Michael Jackson was a phenomenon. From the age of 5 he could be found watching James Brown's extravagant stage antics for hours, copying what he saw. Gerald Posner records in his spectacular history of Motown how young Michael brought in the crowds, astonished seasoned executives, wowed the media. And, until the drugs got him, he didn't stop. So Jackson deserves to be regarded as an extraordinary showman. A brilliant, dazzling talent. But as a pioneering figure in the history of rock and pop? I think that is more controversial. He wasn't, as some have suggested, the first black star to appeal to a mass white audience. What about Diana Ross and the Supremes? (""Listen, Diana Ross didn't become a star by being black,"" as Gordy puts it.) Nor was he, by some distance, the first disco dance
act. He brought the curtain down on the Motown era. As Gordy says of the Jackson 5: ""They would be the last big stars to come rolling off my assembly line."" The last, not the first. Jackson's claim to greatness is more prosaic. He sold a lot of records. He may have competed with the Osmonds as a kid, but he outran them, outsold them, outlasted them. Indeed he outsold everyone. I think the right judgment on Jackson's career is that he was a magnificent entertainer, a thriller (sorry), but not someone who shaped pop history. And it is worth calibrating that judgment finely — spending a little time on it — because it prompts bigger questions. Why, given his status, did Jackson's death make such an impact? Why was it covered wall to wall in upmarket newspapers as well as downmarket ones? Why did it attract more serious attention than
The street-fighting men became doctors and Cabinet ministers
the passing of Elvis and John Lennon, both of whom were undeniably more culturally important? The answer is not that newspapers and others got their assessment of Jackson wrong. It is that in the nearly 30 years since Lennon's death society has changed fundamentally. The culture war that has been raging for 50 years or so has come to an end. And popular culture has won. The primary way of explaining politics has traditionally been class. Democracy allows the peaceful resolution of the clash of material interests. Leaders have been seen as
representatives of one interest group or another. The founders of the Social Democratic Party were told that they would fail because they represented no real class interest. And when they did fail, it seemed to prove the point. Yet another way of explaining politics, certainly the politics of the past 50 years, is through age cohorts. Alongside the class struggle has been the generation gap. When the generation gap first appeared, at the beginning of the 1960s, it was thought to be the result of longer lives. Survivors of the US Civil War could expect to die before they were 50. Survivors of the Second World W7ar might expect to live until they were 65. In these extended lives there came a new period. One of adolescence, of perhaps a decade between being a child and an adult. The alienation of these young people from their parents, something that became obvious in the 1960s, seemed a natural thing that would recur generation after generation. But that isn't quite what happened. As Ian MacDonald writes in Revolution in the Head, his book on the Beatles, while children will always row with their parents, the 1960s generation gap turned out to be a single event It divided those who saw the period before that decade as their reference point from those who saw the period during and after it as their reference point. In the succeeding decades the battle over the 1960s and its legacy has raged in politics. It has raged more strongly and more fiercely in America than here (as things do), but it has raged here too (or some polite British word that means sort of
tdjBmy,*
A phenomenon from the age of 5: but was he a pioneering figure? raged). In the 1960s it was violent. But when young men grow up they generally stop being violent. So as they turned adult, the Sixties street-fighting men quietly carried their liberal values, their egalitarian assumptions, their pop sensibility, their democratic accents, their low-culture hipness into the mainstream. And they became doctors and dentists and Cabinet ministers and civil servants. They changed the elite from the inside. Politicians like Tony Blair and Bill Clinton make no sense viewed through the traditional lens of class politics. In the clash of material interests and economic ideas they are vastly inferior figures to Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Not so if politics is also seen as the clash of
generations. For these were the first political tribunes of the post-1960s generation to reach the highest office, bringing major social change with them. What David Cameron means by modernising the Tory party is more about moving from old to young than from right to left. It is much more about accommodating to the 1960s than to abandoning Conservative economic thinking. The trials and tribulations of Clinton can be best understood by seeing him as a generational politician fighting a knockdown battle against those who hated the 1960s and all it stood for, as he himself acknowledges in a pugnacious defence of that decade in Tom Brokaw's Boom!, a history of the 1960s generation. No more. The battle is ending, the smoke is clearing. The wildest, stupidest ideas of the 1960s New Left have died out. And so too, slowly but surely, are the generations who came before the gap. Barack Obama sees himself, explicitly, as the first representative of a new era — the era of peace after the culture war. ""We have seen the psychodrama of the baby-boom generation play out over the last 40 years,"" he told New York magazine in 2006. ""I think people sort of feel like, OK, let's not relitigate the Sixties 40 years later"". The fact that across class, across race, among those of vastly different educational and material backgrounds an essentially innocuous showman like Michael Jackson can be big news is just one little sign that the culture war is done. We're all pop fans now. Happy Xmas. War is Over. daniel.finkelstein@thetimes.co.uk"

Mike Harvey Michael Jackson's will, made seven years ago, gives his estate to a family trust for his children and names his mother as their guardian. His former wife, Debbie Rowe, is cut out of the will, as is his father, Joe. The will names Diana Ross, 65, the singer and lifelong friend of Jackson, as a guardian to the children if his mother, Katherine Jackson, 79, is unable to take up the. role. Katherine Jackson has already been granted temporary guardianship by a judge. The document, filed in court in Los Angeles yesterday and dated July 7, 2002, gives his estate to the Michael Jackson Family Trust, formed in 2002, and puts a value on the estate at that time at $500 million, consisting al¬ most entirely of ""non-cash, non-liquid assets, including primarily an interest in a catalogue of music royalty rights ... administered by Sony ATV, and the interests of various entities"". A more recent estimate of his wealth from two years ago put it at $237 million. Jackson is survived by three child¬ ren: Michael Joseph Jr, known as Prince Michael, 12; Paris Michael Kath¬ erine, 11; and Prince Michael II, 7. Ms Rowe was the mother ofthe two elder children; the youngest was born to a surrogate mother, never identified.

Ms Rowe, who married Jackson in 1996 and filed for divorce three years later, surrendered her parental rights. She has not indicated whether she intends to contest custody of the two elder children. John Branca, Jackson's lawyer, and John McClain, a music executive and a family friend, were named as co-ex¬ ecutors ofthe will. They said in a joint statement: ""The most important ele¬ ment of Michael's will is his unwaver¬ ing desire that his mother, Katherine, become the legal guardian for his three children. As we work to carry out Michael's instructions to safe-
guard both the future of his children as well as the remarkable legacy he left us as an artist we ask that all mat¬ ters involving his estate be handled with the dignity and the respect that Michael and his family deserve."" The naming ofthe co-executors sets up a potential clash with the family over Jackson's financial affairs. Control ofthe trust to handle his estate goes to Mr Branca and Mr McClain in the will. Paul Gordon Hoffman, a lawyer for Mr Branca and Mr McClain, told a judge yesterday that his clients were the proper people to take over Jack¬ son's financial affairs. He said that Kath¬ erine Jackson's lawyers had already overstepped their authority when they applied, believing that Jackson died without a will, for control of the estate in Mrs Jackson's name on Monday. Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beck- loff yesterday called for a speedy com¬ promise between lawyers for Mrs Jack¬ son and the two co-executors. ""I
would like the family to try to make this work so that we don't have a diffi¬ cult time in court,"" the judge said. One of Jackson's most lucrative as¬ sets is his stake in the vast Sony-ATV Music Publishing Catalog, which includes music by the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Neil Diamond and could be worth $2 billion. The five-page will is signed by Jackson, and each para¬ graph includes his scrawled initials. Another lawyer for the executors, Je- ryll S. Cohen, told Judge Beckloff that Mr Branca and Mr McClain could ne¬ gotiate a deal this week to minimise a hit to Jackson's estate from the refund of an estimated $85 million in tickets sold for a series of London concerts. Jackson had been preparing for those concerts when he died, aged 50. Claims have surfaced that he may have been taking a sedative for insom¬ nia in the days preecding his death. Cherilyn Lee, a nutritionist who was working for the singer, said that she re¬ jected his demands for the drug, Dipri- van, which is given intravenously. Jack¬ son told her that he had been given it in the past by an unnamed doctor. Doses beyond the medically recom¬ mended amount can stop a person's breathing, leading to cardiac arrest. Ms Lee said: ""I don't know what hap¬ pened there. The only thing I can say is he was adamant about this drug.""

Being Wimbledon fortnight, it seems appropriate to eye up Bjorn Borg's accounts. Well, rather the public underwear and fashion company that bears the legendary tennis player's name. It is a successful business with profits of £10 million last year but 30 years after the greatest triumphs of the most famous sweatband in the game, it is hard to imagine that so many of us would be wearing anything bearing his name under our trousers. Such is the 21st century, at least so far, that traditional brands have seen their power eaten away by celebrity — perhaps the categoiy of people who best understand how to work the modem mass media. No doubt, 25 years from now, there will be a line of Andy Murray underwear, assuming he can match some of Borg's, or
even Fred Perry's achievements. There's no shortage of celebrity around to talk about this week — the death of Michael Jackson has been accompanied by the biggest spike in sales for a deceased artist. An analysis of his posthumous sales shows total album sales rose from 10,000 in the week to June 21 to 422,000 in the seven days following. That one week represents two thirds of the entire catalogue album sales (635,000) Jackson managed in all of 2007. It is easy to dismiss the emotion following Jackson's death as another outburst of mawkish, synthetic Diana-style grieving. But the intensity of these events, their meaning for ordinary people who might not spend too much time battling to get to grips with the latest bit of education policy, never mind whether it is worth ""topslicing"" the BBC licence fee, is very real. So, with all this ""celebonomics"" in mind, perhaps there could be something to Simon Cowell's plan to go into business with Sir Philip Green — even if, at first glance, the early excitement about the venture seems to be based on no more than the fact that two famous businessmen getting
together, accompanied by a picture of them both topless sunning themselves somewhere near the exclusive Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados. Here's the bull case. The problem with the Cowell business at the moment is that it is too much based on, er, Cowell. His problem, as he readily admits, is that he is spending so much time on screen, with the X-Factor and American Idol in particular, that there is little time to develop the rest of the SyCo business, beyond the already
considerable sums of cash that he generates from phone-ins relating to the shows and the royalties on the records sold by the acts that emerge. What Sir Philip needs to do is get hold of some ideas from Simon Fuller, Cowell's rival impresario, who controls the format rights to American Idol; Cowell is merely a fantastically well paid employee.
What Fuller does is take talent such as Andy Murray, and of course David Beckham, and sell them as brand sponsors, and occasionally as brand owners (think Beckham fragrances). That kind of thing is where Sir Philip ought to be looking — although it has to be conceded from a merchandise point of view that it is not obvious that the public are clamouring to wear Susan Boyle eau de cologne. Solving that problem might require Cowell to come up with some other celebrity-heavy television formats. Amid all of this, the networks — ITV and Idol's broadcaster Fox — look like hapless bystanders, except that they make so much money from advertising around the programmes. Fox is reckoned to have made $900 million (£550 million) from American Idol. As long as they get a share of the extras, it doesn't matter too much if programme producers snaffle most of the rest. ITV has historically been more constrained in its ability to jack up advertising rates for programmes such as Britain's Got Talent but if complex restrictions are removed by the Competition Commission, you can be sure its income in that
area will increase hugely. All of which suggests that the trend to ever more celebrity-based brands is unlikely to go away. After all, ITV's cash constraints mean that it is cutting back on drama, while secretly wishing it could run more £1 million-an-episode celebrity talent shows, which alongside sports, are what advertisers want. Even over at Wimbledon, having the roof on and letting matches run into the night, means more peak-time exposure for the likes of Andy Murray. All the cash, in other words, is behind the television star machine. The challenge for any combination of Cowell and Green is to harness enough of it. Remember, too, that at some point Britain's Got Talent will fade from popularity (think of Big Brother) and not every X Factor produces a talent as marketable as Leona Lewis. In the age of tears for Michael Jackson and, of course, Bjorn Borg pants, there is consumer demand for any famous name — although, when one starts to think about it, that is enough to make one wonder when the next episode of Gardeners' World is on. dan,sabbagh(9thetimes.co.uk"
"July 03, 2009","['Caitlin Moran']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","1 up Michael Jackson","2009-07-03","","Michael Jackson","It was definitely the story ofthe week. It will probably be the story ofthe year. And, who knows, maybe it will even be the story of this decade, if CW's campaign for ""Jodie Marsh Getting A Tattoo On Her Shoulder Of Some Broccoli — Because She Likes Broccoli"" as Story ofthe Decade fails to pick up any more support. But since Michael Jackson died there can be no doubt that there are thousands of people who need to be given a meeting-place — a pilgrimage-point — to discuss their feelings about his passing. In the wake of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, that place was outside Kensington Palace. People gathered to lay flowers, sing and take advantage ofa unique moment in time to open up to complete, but sympathetic, strangers. And in its own way, CW would like to make this column a Kensington Palace to a sector of like-minded souls, too. People who, since they heard that Michael Jackson was no more, have wanted to reach out to others who feel the same. CW thinks you know who you are. You are the people who — from the first moment they heard, up until this second and, quite possibly, onwards, into the rest oftheir lives —just went, ""Men"" ""Men"" about everything. ""Men"" to it all. Michael Jackson is dead! Meh. Was it the doctor who killed him? Meh. The doctor didn't kill him! Meh. He's going to displayed in a glass coffin at Neverland, after being taken there in a white carriage! Meh. CW isn't affecting a posture of knowing cynicism, you understand. This is not an adolescent, ""seen it all before, man, meh"" —because, clearly, we have never seen anything like a dead celebrity being displayed in a glass coffin before. Except in Snow White. Kind of. No — CW isn't being studiedly casual at all. It fully acknowledges that a man — a human being, just like the rest of us, with family, and friends, and children — has died. It is news that, quite rightly, travelled the world in minutes, mainly because the brilliant music of Michael Jackson will be played on this Earth for as long as there are humans around who register a simple joy in dancing. It's just that C W feels this comforting... listlessness about the whole thing. Almost as if it realised that the death of an ailing, unhappy-looking pop star it had never met and who lived thousands of miles away has nothing to do with CW whatsoever. CW feels that there are possibly thousands — if not millions — of people who felt like it did on hearing the news: ""Oh. Well, that kind of makes sense. Yes, dying is the kind of thing he would be doing around about now. It's perhaps a little earlier than I would have placed a bet on, but it's certainly not as unexpected as him, say, suddenly marrying Elvis Presley's daughter."" For the first time in modern culture, a gigantic news event has occurred which has been met by an absolutely effortless sense of perspective. It is as though we have all gathered together in a big circle, held hands and shrugged — for Michael.

Mike Harvey Los Angeles A custody battle for Michael Jackson's children is likely after his former wife told a local television station: ""I want my children."" Debbie Rowe said that she would be seeking a restraining order against Jackson's father, Joe, to keep him away from Michael Joseph Jr, 12 — known as Prince Michael — Paris Michael Katherine, 11, and Prince Michael II, 7, also known as Blanket. Joe Jackson admitted in a 2003 interview that he had whipped his children, including Michael. Ms Rowe,
who is the mother of the two elder children but is believed to have signed away custody rights, is the latest figure to join the fight for Jackson's legacy. The singer's mother, Katherine, 79, was granted temporary custody of all three children on Monday and is looking after them at the family compound in Encino, Los Angeles. She is still married to Joe Jackson and although he often lives in Las Vegas he has been seen at the family home this week. Late yesterday a judge delayed a guardianship hearing that had been

scheduled for Monday, at the request of both Ms Rowe's lawyers and those ofthe singer's mother. It will now take place on July 13. NBCLA reported on its website that Ms Rowe told a reporter in a 90-minute telephone conversation that she was willing to submit to any
testing, including of her DNA, to prove that she is the mother of the singer's two elder children. Jackson's youngest child was born to an un¬ known surrogate mother. Ms Rowe is also reported to have said that she would submit to psychological testing. Her lawyer, Eric M. Rowe, appeared to backtrack later last night, telling reporters that she had not reached a final decision on whether to seek custody. Experts say that she has the strongest legal claim to Jackson's two elder children, as she is their natural mother, even though she has rarely seen them in recent years. In the NBCLA interview Ms Rowe said that she would be happy to accept custody of the third child too, but did not expect the court to award it. Ms Rowe, a former nurse for Jackson's dermatologist, married him in 1996 but filed for divorce in 1999. In a 2001 petition asking to sever her parental rights, she wrote that she thought that Jackson was doing a good job: ""Michael has been a wonder¬ ful father to the children, and I do not wish to share any parenting responsi¬ bilities with Michael because he is doing so well without me."" In 2003 she petitioned to have those rights restored after Jackson was arrested on child molestation charges, and an appeal court sided with her. Jackson and Ms Rowe apparently

reached a fmancial settlement in 2006 but the terms have never been officially disclosed. A memorial for Jackson will be held at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles after plans for a public wake at'his ranch, Neverland, were abandoned. Rartdy Phillips, chief executive of AEG Live, said that the event would probably take place on Tuesday and be simulcast on big screens outside the arena, with free entry for fans. The family has ruled out private or public viewings of the body at Jack¬ son's Neverland ranch, apparently after the logistics of handling tens of thousands of fans proved too difficult at the remote location. The cause of Jackson's death has still not been confirmed but police have drafted in officials from the federal Drug Enforcement Administra¬ tion to investigate. The agency will examine claims that Jackson abused prescription drugs and may have been taking a dangerous sedative used in operating theatres to induce uncon¬ sciousness. DEA officials have powers to investigate Jackson's doctors. Rehearsal footage of Jackson, filmed just two days before he died of a heart attack, was released yesterday by AEG, showing Jackson appearing vigorous as he danced during a long day of rehearsals at the Staples Centre on July 23."

The rumoured reuniting of boyband Blue, after a recent one-off date, just doesn't cut it, however much you love All Rise.

Stewart Copeland, founding member of the Police, will narrate the show, which cost £5 million to stage. The Proms at the Royal Al¬ bert Hall hosts the debut of drum 'n' bass star Goldie as a classical composer, after his success as a contestant on the BBC series Maestro, in which he came second to Sue Perkins.

local council threatened to close 11 libraries (out of 34 in the area) in order to save costs, but the public outcry prompted this inquiry that will test what a ""comprehensive and efficient"" library service should look like. This seemingly esoteric investigation could have huge implica¬ tions for libraries everywhere. Those worried about the future of musical theatre can rest easier: a fortnight ago Arts Council England announced a grant of £188,860 to Perfect Pitch Musicals, an organisa¬ tion dedicated to developing contemporary British musicals. In July the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is expected to announce the first results from the Government's scheme to offer free theatre tickets to the under-26s. The origi¬ nal plan was to offer 600,000 free seats over the next two years and officials report that early indications are that young people's appe¬ tite for a freebie is holding up well. Our leading theatres are facing up¬ heaval. The Stage recently report¬ ed that Live Nation, the UK's largest theatre operator, has put its entire stock of British venues up for sale. The paper expected that the move ""could see the biggest overhaul in UK theatre ownership in a decade"". Live Nation owns 17 British theatres, including the Apollo Victoria and Lyceum in the West End. Summer arts festival fever begins in Man¬ chester, whose International Festival (mif.co. uk, until July 19) includes Rufus Wainwright's opera Prima Donna. In August attention switch¬ es to Edinburgh, with its Fringe, international, art and (later) TV festivals. This year critics will
be watching how the annual comedy prize (for¬ merly the Perrier and If.Comedy awards, bril¬ liantly satirised in Annie Griffin's movie Festi¬ val) fares without sponsorship.

He's con¬ stantly being interviewed or sing¬ ing his autobiographical songs about rehab and falling in and out of love, and his ""story"" is so well known that there are quite a lot of people who know much more about the man than the music. , There's his precocious childhood (he first performed at the age of 6) divided between America and the French part of Canada. His close but at times strained rela¬ tionship with his parents, the folk singers Loudon Wainwright and Kate McGarrigle, who divorced when Rufus was 3, and didn't like it very much when he told them that he was gay. His promiscuous early adoles¬ cence; the brutal rape in Hyde Park at 14 that pitched him into seven miserable years of sexual abstinence. A nearly fatal addiction to crystal meth, recovery; his obsession with Judy Garland and the re¬ creation of her concert at Carnegie Hall. And, of course, his favourite subject, star¬ dom.

He remains infectiously charming, however, puppyish, delightfully catty and, despite the ""you knows"" and the ""likes"" that pepper his conversation and the double entendres he can't help making (every time he says the word ""ballsy"" or ""blow"" he starts sniggering), he is obviously bright and reflective, as well as rampantly (and self-confessedly) egomaniacal. He looks a little wan and unhappy, though, because he is recovering, he says, from Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball the night before, at which news had reached him of Michael Jackson's death. ""I'm a bit sad about Michael Jackson,"" he says in that languid drawl that loads every¬ thing he says with pathos or light sarcasm. ""It's tragic that he ended that way, mangled and poor and dead and about to make this big comeback."" But he brightens up quickly enough when a few seconds later he turns his atten¬ tion back to the subject at hand: his first opera, Prima Donna, which is to be staged next week at the Manchester Festival. He is ""elated"" about his new project, describ¬ ing it as ""just a day in the life ofa singer and the different things she does"". Unsurprisingly, considering who wrote it, ""there's a scene in it where she [the main character, a fading opera singer, Regine Saint Laurent] does an interview and it's kind of hilarious ... If you replace the prima donna with me, it's very, very reveal¬ ing about my inner life and my experience in showbusiness and some ofthe extremes I have been driven to."" He's fish ing to be asked more about these ""extremes"", but when no question comes he continues undeterred: ""It's a bit like — I'm not in any way putting it on the same level as that — but, you know the Madame
Bovary 'c'est moi' Flaubert comment?"" Then he lets out the first of many of his fa¬ mous donkey laughs. Whatever you think of the man or his music, it's extremely difficult not to like him in person. Prima Donna was commissioned by the New York Met, which cancelled it when it emerged that Wainwright had written the libretto in French. (""They commissioned me without telling me it had to be in Eng¬ lish."") And because he is as businesslike a Grammy-winnning singer-songwriter as it is possible to be, and because his mother is fighting a protracted battle with a rare form of cancer, Wainwright simply cut his losses and started looking for other takers. Nevertheless he never misses an oppor¬ tunity to have a bitch about the Met: ""Any¬ thing that gets done at the Met, you need to wait at least five years until it gets into the system and I don't have that kind of time... for personal reasons."" By the way, his mother is ""doing really well right now but it's really been up and down for the past few years and ... I know it's kind of sick-sound¬ ing, but opera really is our baby. And I wanted her to see it and I'm sure she will be around for the next one and all of that but I couldn't take that gamble at the time."" Rejection by the Met caused Wain¬ wright a great deal of disappointment and had almost fatal repercussions for Prima Donna, which seemed for a while to have been blacklisted. And although he's been an opera fan as long as he can remember, writing an opera himself almost put him off for life, he claims, not entirely convinc¬ ingly. ""A lot of innocence was lost, shall we say, in the making of this project. I think I really placed a lot of elements of opera on a pedestal before this and the closer I got the more I realised that these people are extremely fallible and somewhat nasty."" He says that there were moments when he wanted to walk away, go back to New York and hang out with Jaern, his German boyfriend of three years, and ""never go to the opera again"". But, no surprise here, he stuck it out — he's a pro after all — and having his own opera performed has been a lifelong ambition. Had the project fallen through, he says, he would have ""died a mis¬ erable man"" (Wainwright turns 36 at the end of this month). The worst part, he says, was when he delivered the libretto and the production

WW I think the opera world is really used to dealing with dead people ""V .iff A A team didn't seem to want to have anything more to do with him. ""They kind of took it and now they're going to do with it what they want and there was never a moment when they said: 'We are really lucky to have this work'."" He concedes that in fact they probably did say it—""a lot of this is in my head too. I was just so vulnerable and I really put myself out there. It was very traumatic and sometimes ..."" There is a pause. ""I think the opera world is really used to dealing with dead people. And, really, I did feel dead at a certain point. It was handed over and it was like: 'Why don't you become Wagner or Verdi who's, like, buried and we'll do what we need to do.'"" What they had failed to realise, appar¬ ently, was the golden opportunity they now had to learn from a master of live per¬ formance: ""I spent half of my time on stage; I'm dealing with audiences all the time; I have a certain gauge of a room as a per¬ former — honestly, I don't know of any other composer who has."" Well, there is one other obvious candi¬ date — Damon Albarn, who wrote the opera Monkey for the same festival two years ago. It was considered a triumph, visu¬ ally if not always musically, but Wain¬ wright is headed towards favoured terri¬ tory now (himself) and we've already moved on to why he thinks the opera world needs to ""evolve"" and how ""by getting a bunch of hot guys together and calling them Divo or whatever they've'really gone for the really low Britney Spears kind of look to sex it up. And I think it's such a tragedy and such a mistake for that world."" How would he suggest they rectify this error? ""They should ... take an example from my career. Heh heh heh! And keep it aboutthe music."" But there remains the problem of who, besides Wainwright, is qualified to bring opera to the masses. That's a tough one, he says. And for a while he does a good impression of a person actually mulling the question over: ""Somebody who is alive right now? You know, Paganini or Chopin, I mean they were al! performers as well but, right now? The performer-composer thing is not that existent... It's hard. I don't know."" After a few more minutes of this he blurts out the inevitable: ""I don't think any¬ one could do it but me!"" There follows another round of delighted cackling. Is he an egomaniac? ""That's what it takes!"" he says cheerfully. ""I admit it! I've always had a ballsy outlook, being gay. Heh heh heh."" He's been called pretentious and arro¬ gant but, actually he's neither. Self- obsessed in a very upfront way, definitely, but, perhaps more significantly, terrified of being excluded. And, good grief, he's com¬ petitive. As a trial run, he recently per¬ formed at an opera festival in Switzerland. First up was Mahler's Fifth Symphony. ""They got like 15,000 hits on podcasts."" Next was Wainwright, belting out, as he put it, ""a couple of Mozart tracks. I got, like, 70,000 hits, you know. And I think that is an element which is intimidating."" Prima Donna is at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, on July 10 (0844 8472275) 12,14,17 and 19 (0844 8154961)"

Chris Ayres Los Angeles is a city in mourning. And by that we mean Los Angeles is a city with dollar-signs spinning in its neon eyeballs, thanking its lucky stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for the Celebrity Death of the Century. What with the housing market and the Dow Jones and the unemployment figures, it couldn't have come at a better time. With only three days to go before the Funeral To End All Funerals — or the Memorial To End All Memorials, as it might more accurately be called — this city has suddenly found itself the direct recipient of what can only be termed the 2009 Michael Jackson Stimulus Package. And just how stimulating is Tues¬ day's $25-per-head deathapalooza at the Staples Centre going to be? ""It's going to be huge. Massive,"" promises Brian Oxman, one of the singer's less publicity-shy former lawyers. In fact, up to a million people from across the globe are already supposed¬ ly on their way. Tuesday was chosen as the date, because on Wednesday the venue had already been booked — by a circus, of all things. The money generated by all this will be staggering. Think of the flowers that will have to be shipped in. Think of the hot dogs that will have to be eaten. Think of the novelty bobble- heads that will have to be purchased. More than any of that, think of all those hourly lawyers' and publicists' fees that will have to be billed, and the new Mercedes AMGs and Viking kitchen appliances that will undoubt¬ edly be purchased once the cheques have cleared. To see what's happening to this city all you need to do is elbow your way through the crowds on Hollywood Boulevard: Jackson has done for LA what TARP (troubled asset relief pro¬ gramme) did for Wall Street. A fort¬ night ago the place was half empty. Now it's a zoo. Jackson impersonators are on every comer. Thriller is blaring from every bursting-at-the-the-seams tourist emporium. And the queue for the StarLine tour, which will take you (via open-topped bus) to the points of historical interest in Michael Jack¬ son's life, is snaking around the block. The frenzy is such that many well- wishers ended up laying flowers at the wrong star on the Walk of Fame last weekend — they didn't realise that there are, or were, two Michael Jack- sons, one of them a radio talk-show host born in Britain — and that the other one's star had been covered up by red carpet for the premier of Briino, the new Sacha Baron Cohen film. But it's all good for business. You can only imagine the guilty smiles in the boardroom of Merlin En¬ tertainments Group, which at the height of the housing bubble bought Madame Tussauds for £1 billion and then proceeded to build a multilevel, 44,000 sq ft museum next to Grau- man's Chinese Theatre —just in time for the world's economy to collapse. It is due to open in three weeks. And thanks to Jackomania it might actual- ir.ivi irn

ly end up paying for itself. LA hasn't been on people's minds so much since Paris Hilton went to jail. Every day this week Anderson Coop¬ er — the matinee idol of America's cable news business — has been broad¬ casting on the roof of the CNN build¬ ing, posing in golden sunlight against
the backdrop ofthe Hollywood sign. A city can't buy that kind of advertising. Especially not LA, which has been so ravaged by the economy that it can barely afford to keep the traffic lights switched on at night. But the real financial beneficiaries of Jackson's death have yet to be decid¬ ed. For now, the talk from his family, friends and lawyers might be about toxicology reports and child custody arrangements, but the issue with per¬ haps the most lasting consequences will be the place of Jackson's burial — which will undoubtedly become a Dis¬ neyland-style franchise that will gener¬ ate vast sums of money, every day, of every year, in perpetuity. While the sideshow ofthe Staples Centre memo¬ rial goes on, this is what the real pow¬ er-brokers of LA will be talking about. Neverland is the natural choice. Jackson's brother, Jermaine, has made it clear that this is his first choice — although it is doubtful how much clout he has within the clan. He told a cable news channel on Thursday night: ""I really feel this is where he should be rested because it's him. It's serene."" For the most part, tourism ex-
perts agree. Roger Brooks, CEO of Destination Development Inter¬ national, said: ""Neverland embodied who Michael Jackson was — the good and the bad. I think it could draw about one million visitors a year."" He added that Neverland clearly had the capacity for a such a role because it was significantly bigger than Grace- land, the former home of Elvis Presley in Memphis that for years has operat¬ ed successfully as a multimillion-dol¬ lar cash machine. But turning Neverland into a mini- Disneyland would have profound con¬ sequences for the rustic wine country of the Santa Ynez Valley that sur¬ rounds it — as the hundreds of journal¬ ists who attempted to book hotel rooms in the nearby town of Los Olivos discovered. Put simply, there aren't any hotel rooms. And the hotels and yuppie B&Bs that do exist in the surrounding towns of Solvang and Buellton sold out within hours of rumours emerging that a wake would be held up there this weekend. Another problem: Neverland, which is three hours away from LA, isn't even accessible via a fully paved road. It's halfway up a dirt track in a bear re¬ serve — which presumably helped to keep paparazzi away. For a million people to go there every year would at the very least require a new two-lane highway to be built. Added to that, Neverland has also been stripped bare because of Jack¬ son's financial problems before his death. ""We removed everything — the gates, the fireplaces, the chandeliers,"" says Darren Julien, who was hired by the singer to help to organise an auc¬ tion of his possessions. It's not clear who now owns all the stuff, or if the new operators of Neverland would have to buy it back. Given all this, it was no surprise when the Jackson family cancelled the public wake that was supposed to be held at Neverland this weekend. But what now? There are two obvi¬ ous places for Jackson to be buried in LA. First is the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boule¬ vard by the 101-freeway, which was sat¬ irised by the British novelist Evelyn Waugh in his 1948 novel The Loved One. If only Waugh could see the place now. If enough money changes hands you can create a tomb that re¬ sembles Superman's Fortress of Soli¬ tude. With the resources of the Jack¬ son estate involved the mind boggles at what could be achieved. But a more likely resting place is LA's other great resting place: the For¬ est Lawn Memorial Park, on the valley side of the Hollywood Hills, overlook¬ ing Warner Bros studios. No other funeral home — not even Hollywood Forever — is quite as skilled in the industry of death, and out-of-town visi¬ tors could easily be catered for and ac¬ commodated by the vast University Studios complex only a few blocks away. Forest Lawn's motto: ""Celebrate a Life"". It even comes with an asterisk, reminding you that it's a trademark.

When Michael Jackson died last week Randy Phillips, the promoter who committed $50 million (£31 million) to the King of Pop's comeback, seemed to be heading for financial disaster. Summoned to Jackson's Beverly Hills mansion after a panicky call from the singer's manager, Frank DiLeo, Mr Phillips arrived as the ""am¬ bulance was just coming out of the gates"" — forcing him to turn tail and head to the UCLA Medical Centre. There he waited for ""an hour, an hour and a half with Mr DiLeo before being told the worst: the superstar who was supposed to fill 50 nights at the O2 arena in London was dead. If Mr Phillips — chief executive of AEG Live, the company behind the O2 arena — was grief-stricken he did not let it show, or slow him down. AEG Live had spent up to $30 million on
production costs for the Jackson shows, and advanced the singer $10 million to $20 million, according to industry estimates. That made it $50 million down — and there were $85 million in sold tickets to refund. And 50 nights to fill. What has happened since has been a PR masterclass. The surge in sym¬ pathy for Jackson has, in fact, created a huge commercial opportunity while AEG has largely escaped blame for signing the singer for 50 concerts — or paying his controversial doctor Conrad Murray. Mr Phillips began taking to the air¬ waves, and behind the scenes AEG rap¬ idly developed a strategy that involved the release of fresh information each day. In the weekend after Jackson's death, as questions mounted about how the singer had died and the drugs he was receiving, AEG faced difficult questions as to why the company had
agreed to meet Dr Murray's wages. But his answer — ""You don't argue with the King of Pop"" — seemed to be enough. The focus moved away from the company and on to the doctor. At the same time Mr Phillips was already referring to Jackson's rehears¬ als that had taken place in the Staples Centre two days before his death, in an effort to demonstrate that AEG had not caused his death through over¬ work. With the funeral not until next week and the toxicology report weeks away, AEG became one of the few sources of genuinely new information on the story. A check of the insurance policy re¬ vealed that about $17.5 million was thought to be recoverable. But there are doubts over whether AEG Live would get its money back if Jackson's autopsy revealed he was seriously un¬ well when he signed up to the This Is It tour. ""Lost profits"" from when the
O2 is empty are not covered, and while Jackson's dates in 2010 will almost cer¬ tainly be covered it will be hard to fill the 27 summer dates this year. One Phillips ruse worked well. Those who had bought tickets were given the chance to receive them in lieu of a refund. Indications are that ""40 to 50 per cent"" will accept this of¬ fer, saving AEG $40 million in losses. It also became clear that AEG had photographs and video footage of Jack¬ son's last rehearsals. The value was rising as fans went on a buying frenzy. Mr Phillips released the first pic¬ tures of Jackson in rehearsals on Tues¬ day and the video followed on Thurs¬ day. Then there was talk of a DVD, which would be a chart-topper, bring¬ ing a windfall for the family estate — and its publisher, AEG. It is hardly surprising that Mr Phil¬ lips can say: ""I'm heartbroken but the company's fine."""

It's official—rock stars do not get old and simply fadeaway
I ^^ Elvis Presley, Keith Moon, now Michael Jackson. Rs&> limi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Brian Jones, John fartf*****^ Lennon, ofcourse. That guy in the Pretenders, that othei gu> in the Pretenders, one ofthe blokes from Wings... ei m lohn P ntwistle... oh yes, then Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochian and Gene Vincent. Anyway, you get the idea. Rock stars die vou ng But is that 1 eally true? Yes, Michael Jackson is dead, but the rest of the Jackson 5 are still with us. Brian Jones is gone, but the rest ofthe Stones are out on tour most ofthe time. Mick Jagger will soon be on stage singing Gimme Sheltered Housing. Half of The Who may have died, but the other half didn't die before they got old. It is possible — isn't it? — that the early death of rock stars is a myth caused by the availability heuristic. A heuristic is a mental shortcut that we use to make quick judgments. The availability heuristic is the way, in the absence of full information, in which we use vivid examples that are easy to hand and treat them as if they were representative. So without access to a full database tki th hlth ttf ck st it is
tracking the status of rock stars easiest to recall the number of famous dead stars. Easiest, but hardly scientific. After all, in any population there will be tragic young deaths. Who knows if the deaths we read about arejust the number we would expect? The answer is that a group of academics at the Centre for Public Health, at Liverpool John Moores University, knows. For they have taken the trouble to create a large database of rock stars. In 2000 an international poll of 200,000 fans, experts ancl critics identified the All-Time Top 1,000 albums. The academics then tracked clown the birth dates ancl what they tactfully call the ""survival status"" of all the solo performers ancl group members with an album in this list. They then compared this data with what are known as cohort life tables, which provide tbe historic survival expectation ofa group of individuals with the same date of birth. The paper is a very careful, rather
yl impressive, piece of work, and the authors did not neglect to use race-specific cohort tables. It would have been fun (for me, at least; I think that the public health professionals would have viewed it differently) if all this work had resulted in the discovery that rock stars died at the normal rate. Instead it confirmed the folk wisdom that sex ancl drugs and rock'n'roll (mainly drugs, really) are bad for you. The authors say: ""From three to 25 years post fame, both North American and European pop stars experience significantly higher mortality (more than 1.7 times) than demographically matched populations in the USA and LIK. respectively."" In many ways their second finding is more interesting. After 25 years of fame, relative mortality in European pop stars begins to return to population levels. But it doesn't do so in North America. And there is also a big difference between stars reaching fame before I960 ancl those reaching fame after that. These differences suggest that while self-destructive behaviour might be connected to the creativity that brings forth rock music, there is certainly a large role played by a destructive social norm among stars. Or then again, as we consider opposite perhaps there are simply a lot of undetected murders. Why was Jackson embarking on a 50-date stint at the Oj? He may have needed the money to keep Bubbles in peanuts, but surely he could have rounded up the old gang and made a record? Marie Connolly and Alan Krueger, of Princeton University, supply the answer in their paper Rockonomics: The Economics of Popular Music. Tbe paper is a comprehensive survey, but a key conclusion is this — rock musicians are going to move from being recording art ists to becoming troubadors. Most rock bands find that the advance from their record companies is quickly eaten up by recording costs and that their royalties from sales go on promotion. The record deal, in other words, involves setting up the band so that it gets an audience but doesn't yield much hard cash. The real money then comes from touring. This is becoming more and more the case as new technologies develop. ""Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity,"" said David Bowie, advising his fellow musicians that ""you'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left"". Economists now call this the Bowie Theory. daniel.finkelstein@thetimes.co.uk

Army commander's death sparks
Military chiefs and politicians clash over failure to provide armoured vehicles and helicopters in Afghanistan campaign, Michael Evans reports
The death of the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards has reignited the row over the lack of vital military equipment for British troops in Afghanistan. The Government has been accused of providing too few transport helicop¬ ters, forcing soldiers to travel by road, the main target of Taleban attacks. There were also charges that Viking armoured vehicles — the vehicle in which Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Thorneloe was travelling when he was killed — do not have adequate protec¬ tion against Taleban roadside bombs and mines. Major-General Julian Thompson, who commanded 3 Commando Bri¬ gade Royal Marines in the Falklands conflict in 1982, told The Times: ""The question is not whether one vehicle or another is sufficiently armoured, it's about the lack of helicopters. We need more helicopters in Afghanistan to ferry troops in high-risk areas."" General Sir Mike Jackson, former Chief of the General Staff, said: ""In a general sense, the MoD has been spending too much money on fast jets
for the RAF rather than on helicop¬ ters."" But he added: ""If you want to find someone to blame for this inci¬ dent, however, start first with the enemy."" Liam Fox, the Shadow De¬ fence Secretary, blamed the lack of hel¬ icopters on Mr Brown's refusal to sup¬ ply adequate funds for the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan when he was Chancellor. ""Gordon Brown denied the Armed Forces the funds they needed,"" he said. However, Bob Ainsworth, the De¬ fence Secretary, denied yesterday that British Forces in Afghanistan suffered from shortages. ""If you ask anybody in Afghanistan they will tell you our forces there are better equipped then they've ever been,"" he said. ""There's been a fantastic improvement in the last couple of years, both in personal equipment and vehicles as well."" He insisted that new vehicles were being brought out as quickly as poss¬ ible and that more helicopters were not the answer. ""We can't conduct the kind of operations we need to conduct in Afghanistan from the air,"" he said. ""Of course, helicopters are needed — we're moving the Merlin helicopter across from Iraq — but ask the guys. doing the job, they can't conduct the operation in great big massive vehicles all the time, they need a range of vehi¬ cles. They need manoeuvrability, they
mmmm-
need to be able to see what's going on and they need to be able to get off the beaten track."" ""But they equally need to get in among the people and to walk around and there's always going to be risk. Ask anybody, even those who have been injured, and they will tell you the risk can never be removed,"" he said. Commanding officers of battle groups such as Colonel Thorneloe use the Viking frequently to ferry them around theatre to visit units, some¬ times because there are not enough helicopters available. Chinook helicop¬ ters, the most vital air asset, are on con¬ stant operations and commanders have to prioritise to ensure they are used for the most important missions. Bad weather, dust storms and me¬ chanical repair reduce availability. Up to eight Merlin helicopters are being transferred from Iraq to Afghanistan but they are being modified for operat¬ ing in Helmand and will not be ready until later this year. They will join the relatively small fleet of Chinooks and Sea Kings already operating in the province, where British troops are con¬ centrated. At least one Chinook is al¬ ways dedicated to casualty evacuation. The Viking was first purchased for the Royal Marines in 2003 and was de¬ signed for operating across snowy ter¬ rain in Norway. It was sent to Hel¬ mand in 2006 as a main troop-carrier. It survived intact for its first year in Afghanistan until the Taleban worked out how best to target the vehicle. Cas¬ ualty rates began to rise and last Octo¬ ber, John Hutton, then the Defence Secretary, said that the new Warthog would replace Viking at a cost of £150 million. Eight soldiers have been killed in Vikings over the past three years. The vehicle — which consists of two tracked vehicle units linked by a steer¬ ing mechanism — was originally ar¬ moured to protect it from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. The most vulnerable part ofthe Viking has been the underside. Also in the pipeline for Afghanistan are Buffalo mine-sweeping vehicles, Snatch Vixen armoured vehicles to re¬ place the vulnerable Snatch Land Rov¬ ers, and an updated version of the Jackal, another armoured vehicle. Yesterday tributes were paid to Colo¬ nel Thorneloe, the most senior British officer to be killed in action since the Falklands conflict. The Prince of Wales, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Welsh Guards, said he was ""horrified"" by the death. ""Having been to visit the Welsh Guards at Aldershot before they left to go to Afghanistan, having met the families and having met Colo¬ nel Rupert's wife, my heart is very much with them,"" said Prince Charles. The Prime Minister said: ""I think the whole country will be mourning to¬ day the deaths of Colonel Rupert Thorneloe and Trooper Joshua Ham¬ mond [who was killed with him]. They were very professional soldiers, they were serving in Afghanistan in the most difficult terrain. Colonel Thor¬ neloe was someone I know, someone I worked with, someone I admired."" Des Browne, the former Defence Secretary who employed Colonel Tho- neloe as his military assistant, said yes¬ terday: ""Rupert worked with me for a year and, like every member in my pri¬ vate office, he was like family to me. It was truly a privilege to have known him. He will be deeply missed.""

^^^ It was predicted to be the *§58ss*- summer of frugal camping, but it has turned out to be the summer of camp, with two figures towering over popular culture: Briino and Jacko. Not since Oscar Wilde advised the young that ""one should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art"" has camping it up been so now. Of course in straitened times we no longer want to be straight: suddenly outlandish-is-us. When Michael Jackson died, and we were force-fed Billie.lean on every supermarket Tannoy, we realised with a jolt how much vve missed the heyday of The Gloved One, the rubbery red and black Thriller suit, the glitter socks, the sheer epicene strangeness of his dancing. But at the same time we were salivating over a future feast of camp, wondering precisely what Bruno would do in his yellow leather lederhosen when finally released next week. Tlie fact that Sasha Baron Cohen's Briino has become an international brand long before he arrives in suburban cineplexes is a sign both of savvy marketing (the surprise descent wearing a white thong on the lap ofthe unfortunate Fminem at the MTV awards) and public fascination. The trend reaches tipping point with the high camp musical Priscilla, Queen ofthe Desert running in the West End, and Britain's Got Talent bringing low camp to family viewing. Indeed, it doesn't get much camper than our popular programming: Britain's Cot Talent, Jimmy Carr, Graham Norton's Eurovision Song Contest, Sfriclly Come Dancing with Bruce Forsyth, and The X-Factor, or as Bruno recently said in an in-character interview in a gay magazine: ""Simon Cowell is my gay icon. Ein totally straight man who dresses like he does and loves scheisse pop miisik."" If only Susan Sontag, the American intellectual who first clearly identified the phenomenon in her seminal 1964 essay Notes on ""Camp"", were here today, she would be in cultural clover. Explaining camp, she went back again to grandmaster Wilde ""We should treat all trivial things vei \ sei iously, and all the serious things of life w ith sincei e and studied triviality."" T his is prcc isely what Baron Cohen does throughout Briino, using the silliest side ot homosexuality to expose the mindless intolerance and gobsmacking
Iii straitened times we no longer want to be straight: suddenly outlandish-is-us stupidity of redneck America It's like
America. Whicker's World on acid. That said, at a preview of Briino (reviews of which are still embargoed), I wanted to go and have dinner instead, so icky was the cheesecake porn, and so sledgehammer were the jokes. It is revealing that Baron Cohen invented the Briino character in the playground as a teenager. But his work fits Sontag's definition: ""To camp is a mode of seduction — one which employs flamboyant mannerisms susceptible ofa double interpretation; gestures full of duplicity, with a witty meaning for cognoscenti and another... for outsiders.""

from page There was a somewhat tasteless Brlino-Jacko crossover moment in the film — a scene cut out si nee the si nger's death —when Jackson's sister La Toya is invited to beon Bruno's""celebrity""chatshow. La Toya hands over her BlackBerry to Bruno, who tries to get Michael's phone number by reading it to his assistant in German. Later La Toya does a runner when she is invited to eat sushi off a fat, naked Mexican. This is freakily reminiscent of thelyricsfrom her brother's song Wanna BeStartin'Somethin, a reflection on stardom and exploitation: ""You're just a buffet"" and ""They eat off of you"". Jackson'sown contribution to camp comes from the middlesex world, somewhere between gay and straight, child and man. Songs such as In the Closet, Leave Me Alone and Threatened reveal fear and sexual indecision. For Jackson, camp was a way of exploringthose issues, ancl a comfortingcloak.a place to hide in the spotlight. Jackson's showmanship began with camp before waltzing off into the weird. But the 50 sold-out shows at London's 0.>showed that, even before his death,Jackson was due fora massive reappraisal. Camp never stays still, so Jackson's version has a retro appeal now. Old-fashioned campness is also seen in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen ofthe Desert—cutting-edge and shocking as a film longago, but now tired asa musical. Incongruity, theatricality and humour are all eternal camp equipment, but the rest keeps changing. Baron Cohen's new definition of camp is more vulgarthan subtle. Briino is a pol itical wrecking bal I, one that could be swung only in primitive parts of America, and would have been laughed off here. But Briino and Jacko share camp's hallmark spirit of extravagance. And even in death, Michael Jackson's camp sensibility rolls on: the mooted lying in stateand the white, horse-drawn funeral carriage show a tragic consistency. kate.muir@thelimes.co.uk • +"

ichael Jackson's untimely death will fuel biographies, album rereleases and conspirf- acy theories for years. But rewind nearly fourdecadesandthere'sanotherdeath.one that bears many similarities to Jackson's, about which startling revelations are still comingto light. Jimi Hendrix was also a black artist who crossed overto a whiteaudience. He dicl for the guitar what Jackson did for the pop video, combining showmanship — playing the guitar with his teeth, behind his back, then setting it on fire — with a musician¬ ship so peerless that on hearing him Eric Clapton considered packing it in. And Hendrix, too, wasafflicted by a fame that came too fast, too heavy; by the money-lubricated machinery of manage¬ ment; and by the drugs that helped him to cope. But there is one key difference. James ""Tappy"" Wright, a former road manager, has come forward with an extra¬ ordinary ciaim about rock's most gifted gui¬ tarist. At first it sounds absurd. But as the 65-year-old granddad lays out his tale while pouring a very un-rock'n'roll cup of tea, you begin to realise that there could be something to it. Hendrix, according to Wright.did not die accidentally in the early hours of September 18, 1970, from choking on his own vomit after a drugs overdose. Instead he was murdered by a ruthless gang who bu rst into the London hotel room of hisgirl- friend, Monika Dannemann, and forced sleeping pills and wine down his throat until hedrowned. A horrific end. if true. But there's more. Wright says he knows the killers' leader, in fact worked for him. It was the man whom Hendrix should have been able to trust above all others: his own manager, M ike Jeffery. Is that possible? ""Mike Jeffery was a dangerous man, no doubt about it,"" says Wright, with a Whitley Bay ""oo"" in ""no doot aboot it"". ""He spent two years in the Army, in the Secret Service [it is known that Jeffery spoke Russian and was stationed in Egypt). Shooting people was fun, he used to say to ine, just like shooting ducks at the fairground. He'd have to creep into people's tents with fixed bayonets, this was in the Suez daysorwhat- ever. The noise was horrible, he said: you could hear the metal scraping against the bones of their ribcage."" In his memoir, Rock Roadie, published last week, Wright says that Jeffery con¬ fessed to the murder over a bottle of bour¬ bon in 1971 The story has spread like wild¬ fire on the internet, but until now no one has had the chance to quiz Wright in per¬ son. Whv did he wait 36 vears to tell the tale? ""1 was scared,"" he says simply, 'fhe man who once bedded 70 groupies in a month is potbellied now, with diabetes and dodgy knees, but Wright never drank or took drugs; bis memory of the Sixties seems sharp. ""Mike Jeffery was not a man you wanted to cross... I was scared of him. The day after he told me, I came in dead nerv¬ ous, like, in case he'd had second thoughts. It was never mentioned again."" Jeffery died in a mid-airplane collision a month later. Why did Wright not come for¬ ward then? Or, in 1993, why did he not give evidence when llendrix's former girl¬ friend, Kathy Etchingham, asked police to re-investigate his death? ""They never asked,"" Wright says. ""The other men who helped Mike Jeffery kill Hendrix, they would have still been alive. And I was worried thatthefactthat 1 hadn't come forward in the first place made me a —■ what do you call it? — an accessory, ln the end, it was Rod Weinberg [a music impresario whoco-wrote the memoir] who persuaded me I had a duty to come clean."" Bob Levine, now in hiseightiesand living in Florida, is one ofthe few key players still alive. As the merchandising manager he worked closely with Jeffery, but even he hadto take him tocourtto retrieve£30,000 lentto save Jeffery from a Mob enforcer. Levine has sent Wright a letter. ""I'm so glad you honoured thetruth,"" he wrote, ""in¬ stead of all that regurgitated s*** that comes out."" The Sixties were Wild West times in the music industry. While the rock stars got high, their managers got rich. Wright's book is more concerned with his own sexploits with groupies, but when pressed, he will recount how Jeffery got him to fly from New York to France, Germany, London and then back, picking up parcels a long the way. ""I knew it was money. From shady individuals, yes. Sometimes royalty cheques, but they were all made out to Yameta, the offshore account Mike Jeffery set up in the Bahamas."" The Animals, whom Mike Jeffery man¬ aged before Hendrix, were once the UK's biggest act afterthe Beatles. They split up in 1966 with just £500 to their name. Their lead singer, Eric Burdon, described that Bahamas account as a ""Bermuda Triangle"" for their money. Hendrix found the same. ,G"" 1GR \J> m.
""Mike Jeffery told them that Yameta would be a tax haven for all their money,"" says Wright. ""But no one got any of it. Jimi died a pauper. The Animals didn't have a pot to piss in."" Jeffery may have been more unscrupu¬ lous than most, but in any business that runs on cash, the Mob is never far behind. Tours in the US had to contend with Mafia control of trucking, baggage handling and stadium concessions. Managers had to be tough nuts to protect their clients. Jeffery was a short man, not given to overt vio¬ lence. Yet in his dark glasses and overcoat heexuded menace. Heflaunted hisconnec- tions with organised crimeand the FBI. But murdering your own star act? Per¬ haps Jeffery was capable of the deed, but what could the motive possibly be? This is where it gets interesting. Jeffery had crippling debts. There were huge expenses from building Hendrix's Electric Lady studio in New York, including a $400,000 loan from Warners; Hendrix's first manager had won a court case grant¬ ing him the next album and a share of all profits; he owed $200,000 in back taxes; and he had recently paid £100,000 to buy out Hendrix's co-manager Chas Chandler (Chandler, reveals Wright forthe first time, was livid with Hendrix for bedding his wife). Yet Hendrix's contract with Jeffery was coining up for renewal. The two men had clashed over not just money but musical direction, too. In 1967 Jeffery had disas¬ trously booked Hendrix as support to the Monkees; the year after that he tried to dis¬ suade Hendrix from recording a double album (Electric Ladyland); and in 1969 he tried to make 1 lencirix go back to using white musicians in his band. According to several sources during his final weeks in London, Hendrix was determined to change management. Jeffery would have been desperate. He couldn't afford to lose his cash cow. But according to Wright, Jeffery had one last get-out-of-jail-free card. Jeffery had taken out a $2 million insurance policy on Hen¬ drix's life. That was standard practice for a manager, but right now it meant Hendrix was worth more to Jeffery dead than alive. It wouldn't have taken much imagina¬ tion to come to this conclusion, either. As a young man Jeffery had profited from two mysteriously well-timed fires, one at a nightclub and another at a coffee bar he owned in Newcastle. The insurance pay¬ ments allowed him to set up management ofthe Animals and open the Club A-Go- Go for them to play in. After Hendrix's death, Jeffery was able to pay off his back taxes, buy out Hendrix's father's share in the Electric Lady studios, and buy himself a house in Woodstock. And ofcourse he continued to cash in on his client's legacy, ln 1973 heeven sent a vir¬ tual Hendrix out on tour — showing a film of Hendrix in concert, with support acts appearing beforehand. So Jeffery had motiveand ability. Had he the opportunity? No one knows where Jef¬ fery was that night. Days later, he was tracked down to Majorca, where he had a nightclub. He expressed surprise, claiming not even to have heard of Hendrix's death. As to thesequenceof events that led up to Hendrix's death, accounts are famously

conflicting. The authority is Tony Brown, whose exhaustive book The Final Days of Jimi Hendrix, came out in 1997. The ambu- ancemen and police who found Hendrix interviewed. All concurthat they found door to the flat open, which suggests a hasty exit. Hendrix was fully clothed, which doesn't sound as if he deliberately took pills to sleep. And he was ""covered in vomit, tons of it over the pillow, black and irown it was"". Thedoctor who examined Hendrix dis¬ covered copious amounts of wine in Hen¬ drix's lungs, but strangely little had had time to be absorbed into his bloodstream — a powerful indication of foul play. Dr John Bannister told The Times in 1993 that by the time his body reached the hospital, ""Hendrix had been dead for some time, without a doubt, hours ratherthan minutes."" The version of events presented by Dannemann had been accepted by bi¬ ographers as fact for 20 years. It is now universally discredited. A German fig¬ ure-skater turneddrug-takerand fan¬ tasist, she was with Hendrix the night he died. She claimed that he fell unconscious when she popped out for cigarettes, that he was alive when the ambulance arrived, that it was their blunders that led to his death. This is denied in every detail by all the authorities involved. It is known, however, that she argued vio¬ lently with Hendrix before he died; and it was her sleeping pills that found their way into Hendrix's system. After his death she became reclusive and litigious. Was she involved in the death? Did Jeffery some¬ how get her out of the way? Or was it she who gave Hendrix nine of the extra- strength tablets? She committed suicide in 1996, so we will never know. Wright doesn't claim to have all the answers — in fact very little ofthe story
pieced together above can be found in Rock Roadie. His ripping yarn of groupies, celebrity encounters and touring devotes just five pages to Hendrix's death. He knew theman, of course. He was there when Hen¬ drix burnt his guitar at Monterey; he went shopping with him for women's clothes to brighten up his look. But he's no historian. So The Times contacted other experts who might shed some light. Roger Pom- phrey made a documentary in 1997 about Hendrix's Electric Ladyland album. A formermusician, he interviewed all thekey players still aliveand immersed himself in the Hendrix literature. ""If I thought there wasn't some credi¬ bility to this story I wouldn't begin to a.sso¬ ciate with it,"" Pomphrey says. He will be moderating a series of public Q&A sessions with Wright atthe Edinburgh Festival.""We all know that the whole world loves a conspiracy. What separates Hendrix's deathisthatf'romthewordgoitwasincredi- bly murky. Monika Dannemann's story changed by the hour. When 1 made my documentary there wereacoupleof people who claimed, offcamera, that Monika was in New York two weeks after Jimi died, and who heard ber in close conversation with Mike.Ieffery. ""Thatsaid, of course I'm expecting a total backlash, people saying why have you waited so long to come out. Having got to know Tappy over the last few months, I suspect he's an honest man."" Joe Boyd made one ofthe first Hendrix documentaries, back in 1973. Asked about Wright's revelation, he says, categorically, ""I think it's absurd."" He knew Jeffery a bit, having dated his secretary. There was a ""sin¬ ister aspect"" to the man, Boyd says, and he ""certainly wasn't the best manager in the world"", but he was intelligent and good to talk to; Boyd can't believe murder. But then Boyd hadn't read up on any ofthe medical
revelations from the Nineties; after hear¬ ing the whole tale, he began to wonder if there was something to it. Next, the Hendrix obsessive Yazid Manou, who befriended Dannemann. Ini¬ tially, he had assumed that Wright was sim¬ ply a desperate figure with a book to pro¬ mote. On more considered reflection, he feels that ""all the elements of [Wright'sl story could he true, but it's difficult to check"". And he put us on to a vital witness. Alan Douglas was Hendrix's friend and producerduringthe Electric Lady sessions, and masterminded posthumous releases for 20-odd years. Numerous biographies state that Douglas was the man Hendrix wanted as his new manager. ""Absolutely not true,"" Douglas says. Though in his lateseventies, he's still sharp. ""I'm not a manager. We never once talked about it. I thought (here wasn't any problem between me ancl Mike.Ieffery but obviously there was. because I kept hearing from people that Mike was worried 1 was going to steal Jimi."" Confronted about this later. ""Tappy"" Wright sticks to his story. ""1 just heard Mike Jeffery's side of it, but 1 know what he said to me. Maybe he heard the wrong thing, maybe there's more than what Alan Douglas is saying."" Douglas cannot believe Jeffery had any¬ thing to do with the death. But he reveals a fascinating conversation with Jeffery a few days after Hendrix died. ""Mike was bent double, his bead at waist level, in terrible condition with his back. He was feeling a lot of guilt, and told me he wasn't in retrospect treating Jimi the way be should, under pres¬ sure from all the loans. One thing he said to me I don't think I've told anybody, but it's something I'll never forget: 'Every time I was with a woman I thought I could love, I found she was only with meto getTo Jimi'. "" So who do we believe? Who. after all this time, can reconstruct events with any certainty?

Mike Harvey Los Angeles
So many millions of fans tried to regis¬ ter for free tickets to a Michael Jack¬ son memorial service in Los Angeles that they brought down the organis¬ er's website, as squabbles continued over custody of the star's children and more evidence of drug abuse emerged. The service will take place at the Sta¬ ples Center, in downtown Los Ange¬ les, after a funeral attended by family and close friends. The centre, which seats 20,000, was used by Jackson in the days before his death to rehearse for a run of 50 shows in London that had been due to start this month. Fans have until 6pm today to regis¬ ter for the service on the website stap- lescenter.com. A lottery will decide who will qualify for the 17,500 tickets on offer, which will be allocated in pairs to US residents. The Jackson family said the website received more than half a billion hits by yesterday morning, causing the site to crash. The service will be shown live on tel¬ evision and police and organisers warned all those without tickets to stay away. Assistant Police Chief Earl Paysinger said that anywhere from 250,000 to 700,000 people could try to reach the arena, even though a wide area around the Staples Center will be sealed off. A spokesman for the Jackson family declined to comment on whether Debbie Rowe, Jackson's former wife and mother of his two eldest children, would attend the private funeral. She is considering contesting custody of the children, who have been put under the temporary custody of the singer's mother, Katherine. A court hearing has been put back to July 13. Ms Rowe told a TV news reporter that she wanted to keep Jackson's father, Joe, away from his grandchil¬ dren. He has admitted whipping his children with a belt when they were young. He is still married to Kather¬ ine, though the couple are separated. Further details emerged yesterday of Jackson's alleged abuse of painkill¬ ers and other prescription drugs. The powerful sedative Diprivan was found in the rented mansion in Los Angeles where he died. The discovery re¬ inforces claims from a nutritionist treating Jackson that he claimed to have been given a powerful sedative for insomnia before his death. Cherilyn Lee said she repeatedly re¬ jected his demands for the drug, which is used in operating theatres and is given intravenously. The drug has a very narrow therapeutic window, meaning doses not much larger than the medically recommended amount can stop a person's breathing, leading to cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles coroner's office per¬ formed an autopsy on Friday but de¬ ferred a decision on the cause of death, ordering toxicology tests. A second private autopsy has been re¬ quested by the family. AEG, which runs the Staples Center, plans to release a DVD taken from 100 hours of footage of rehears¬ als for the planned shows in London. It is expected that Jackson will be buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The family had hoped to bury him at the Neverland ranch but had difficul¬ ties in obtaining a permit."
"July 06, 2009","['Dr Mark Porter']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","Don't blame it on the opiates — they're still a godsend to medicine","2009-07-06","","Dorit blame it on the opiates — they're still a godsend to medicine","■ 1 omorrow's memorial service for Michael Jackson will be a time to celebrate his achievements and forget his failings — including his rumoured addiction to the opiate painkiller pethidine (Demerol). Being hooked on prescribed painkillers may conjure up a more benign image than abusing heroin, but pharmacologically they are much the same. And Jackson's plight is bound to reinforce the myth and prejudice that surrounds the opiate family. When used properly, opiates such as morphine, diamorphine (heroin) and pethidine are neither dangerous nor addictive and remain one ofthe most useful weapons in a doctor's armoury. ""Among the remedies which it has pleased Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium."" So wrote the physician Thomas Sydenham in 1680, and given the major strides in medicine since then, it is a credit to the opium family that his words still hold true. Opium is the dried extract of opium poppy seed-heads and has been used for millennia to ease pain and discomfort. The active ingredients are opium alkaloids, and morphine — named after Morpheus, the god of sleep — was the first to be isolated in 1806. Since then, other natural components, including codeine, have been identified and pharmacologists have gone on to manufacture synthetic versions such as pethidine (best known for its use during childbirth). All the alkaloids have slightly differing properties but their basic mode of action remains the same in that they mimic naturally occurring painkilling chemicals — encephalins, endorphins and dynorphins — found in the brain. And besides their potent painkilling properties, opiates also induce a sense of euphoria and detachment and have a powerful calming effect. But, as with all drugs, there is a downside. Opiates also suppress the parts ofthe brain that control wakefulness, breathing and coughing, while stimulating the centre responsible for nausea and vomiting: a double-whammy that makes overdose lethal. If loss of consciousness and impaired breathing doesn't lead to respiratory and cardiac arrest, then the combination of vomiting and a blunted cough reflex mean that the victim can choke to death. Lethal overdose is a real risk in anyone injecting the drug intravenously (IV). The onset of influence is much more rapid, and the effect more profound, than slower routes of administration such as taking it by mouth or injecting under the skin or into a muscle — one reason why IV injections are rarely used outside of a hospital. The risk is further compounded by the fact that illegal drug users often have no way of being sure ofthe dose. Suppliers cut their product with so many agents that t^e strength can vary tremendously

Opiates are generally used to let people get on with their lives, not to confine them to bed in a drugged haze
from dealer to dealer, and users play Russian roulette each time they shoot up. Intravenous injection ofthe pharmaceutical-grade opiates, where the dose can be calculated down to fractions of a milligram, is generally very safe and can provide rapid relief in situations such as heart attack, broken bones and after surgery. And in the unlikely event of a reaction, doctors can administer an antidote (naloxone) that can reverse the effects of opiates within minutes. We will have to wait for the results of the post-mortem examination to know what killed Michael Jackson, but speculation has centred on the fact that he suffererd a cardiac arrest shortly after being given an injection of pethidine (or possibly the anaesthetic agent propofol). There is no medical justification for giving intravenous opiates in the circumstances leading up to Jackson's demise, and propofol should only ever be used by an anaesthetist. Either could have caused his heart to stop. But it is not the risk of overdose that concerns most patients. In my experience they tend to be far more concerned about the risk of addiction, and the implication that being put on morphine means that they have been written off by their doctors — both unfounded fears. One ofthe great paradoxes in pain management is that addiction is unusual when opiates such as morphine are used appropriately. If you are prescribed a painkiller because you are in pain, you are unlikely to have problems coming off it when you no longer need it. But if you take the drug purely for its euphoric effects then the risk of addiction is very
high, and can develop within days. If the drug is suddenly stopped (usually because the user runs out of money), there will be a range of unpleasant withdrawal effects, which typically include restlessness, twitching, a runny nose, goosebumps, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea — so-called ""cold turkey"" and one ofthe principle drivers for searching out the next hit. The stigma surrounding the use of opiates is another problem, and one that doctors, particularly those working in the field of cancer, have been battling for years. While high doses may hasten death in a very poorly patient who is nearing the end of his or her life, the drugs themselves have no impact on life expectancy in other patients. Contrary to common perception opiates are generally used to ease pain and suffering and allow people to get on with their lives, rather than to confine them to bed in a drug-induced haze. It has been suggested that Jackson developed an opiate habit after he was prescribed pethidine to ease the pain of burns sustained during an accident in the late Eighties. At first glance this may appear to undermine the idea that appropriate use tends not to lead to addiction, but it is questionable whether he did use it appropriately - particularly in the latter years. The pethidine may have been prescribed, but by what sort of doctor? For more information type morphine into the search engine on the homepage ofwww.patient.co.uk"

True Stories: Maximum Jail More410pm
the Farm in Angola, Louisiana, is the largest maximum-security prison in the US. It houses 5,100. inmates, 95 per cent ofwhom will never be released. The original, highly acclaimed 1998 film about the prison focused on the daily lives of six inmates, and this is a follow-up ten years later. Ofthe six, one man has died of cancer. One was executed. One is released on parole after serving 27 years. One was pardoned after 50 years, and the remaining two are still in prison. But this is not a study of brutality and despair; the prison regime, under Warden Burl Cain, is as humane and civilised as is possible in the circumstances, but it will always remain a hardcore penitentiary. As one prisoner puts it: ""You look at this and you say to yourself, 'This is all there will ever be'. And you look to the future—and there is none. Just empty space."" David Chater

'","This was it... gold bands, red carpets, VIP guests and a made-for-TV event","Chris Ayres Staples Centre, Los Angeles At rest in a 14-carat, gold-plated casket lined with blue velvet, the body of Michael Jackson was carried into the Staples Centre, Los Angeles, for a memorial service and star-studded musical extravaganza that was viewed by at least a billion people around the globe. For the United States it wasn't so much a ""Diana moment"" as a made- for-TV special. Afraid that millions of fans would cause havoc, and barely able to afford the overtime for its police officers and emergency ser¬ vices, LA's city leaders made it virtually impossible for the general public to take part in the service. But as an expression of public grief, it could not have been further re¬ moved from the 1997 funeral and cortege of Diana, Princess of Wales, which drew crowds of up to three million people. When it became clear that only 50,000 people turned up outside the service, a fraction of the million ex¬ pected, some wondered if the city had gone too far in telling people to stay at home, and that the showing was too small for the biggest day of public mourning in US history since the death of Elvis Presley. Even the motorcade of more than 30 cars that carried Jackson's body from a ""private funeral"" at Holly¬ wood's Forest Lawn Cemetery to the Staples Centre was kept secret until the last minute, so that fans could not line the streets in advance to pay their respects. Instead, the convoy of blacked-out Rolls-Royces, Range Rovers and Cadillacs made its way to the memorial service on closed, empty freeways. The result was an Oscars-style event that, aside from the 20,000 guests who either won tickets in a lottery or who were invited by the Jackson family, could be viewed only on television. The Jackson family's guest list was a who's who of African-American power-brokers in music, sports, film and politics: Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Jennifer Hudson, Kobe Bry¬ ant, the Rev Al Sharpton, Spike Lee and Wesley Snipes. Most of the guests arrived in limos and then strolled up a black carpet outside the venue, where fans were taking it in turns to sign two giant posters of Jackson. Notable ab¬ sentees were Mr Jackson's ex-wives, Debbie Rowe and Lisa Marie Presley. Only one guest, Jackson's daughter, Paris Michael Katherine, 11, sobbed un¬ controllably, in perhaps the service's most piognant moment. ""I just wanted to say that ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine. And I just wanted to say I love him so much,"" she said. Mr Sharpton gave a rousing speech
that brought applause from the guests: ""He brought down the colour curtain. It was Michael Jackson who brought blacks and whites and Asians and Lati¬ nos together. It was Michael Jackson who created a comfort level so that people who felt they were separate be¬ came interconnected with his music."" He said that the careers of Oprah Winfrey, Tiger Woods and President Obama would have been impossible without the singer. ""Michael did that, he made us love each other,"" he said.
""I want his kids to know: there was nothing strange about your Daddy. What was strange was what he had to deal with. He dealt with it anyway. Some people came here to say good¬ bye to Michael. I came to say thank you."" Juno Pierre-Louis, 42, a car sales¬ man from New York, one of those who received a ticket in the lottery to be at the memorial, said: ""Offthe Wall came out when I was growing up near the Bronx, and the gang movement was big then. ""But as soon as everyone saw Michael's moves, people stopped kill¬ ing each other and starting having dancing competitions instead. So Michael Jackson means a lot to me. ""[African Americans] tend to walk away from anything that's embraced by the white community — but today I've seen more black folk with the MJ colours on than the white folk."" Mr Obama added his voice to those of the mourners. ""I think like Elvis, like Sinatra, like the Beatles, he be¬ came a core part of our culture,"" he said. ""His extraordinary talent and his music was matched with a big dose of tragedy and difficulty [in] his private life and I don't think we can ignore that."" He said that it was important to ""affirm what was the best of him and that was captured by his music"". Of the 1.6 million people who en¬ tered the lottery for tickets to the memorial service, only 8,750 were told via e-mail that their names had been chosen. Most of them received two passes for the service in the form of a golden wristband. Without a golden wristband, it was impossible to get beyond the massive barriers that formed a huge security perimeter around the Staples Centre. In fact, the perimeter covered such a wide area that it was impossible for un¬ invited well-wishers to glimpse the venue from afar. William Bratton, the city's police chief, said: ""If you're down here, there won't be much to see. You won't get within several blocks of the area."" With the seating capacity of the venue limited to about 16,000, several thousand guests had to watch the service on a giant video screen out¬ side, along with thousands of jour¬ nalists, photographers and television camera operators. Overhead, around 20 news helicopters and other light aircraft circled. It is thought that yesterday's service cost LA about $4 million (£2.46 mil¬ lion), money it can ill-afford in the middle of a state-wide budger crisis. The Staples Centre, home of the LA Lakers basketball team, was where Jackson had been rehearsing two weeks ago for his much-anticipated comeback tour in London. As soon as the set of the memorial service was dismantled yesterday, the venue was taken over by a circus.

The Garden Room Girls Radio 4,11am Tony Blair is one ofthe contributors to this programme about some ofthe women who made him what he is today — or rather what he was when he was PM. For the Garden Room Girls — so called because they occupy a room that overlooks the prime ministerial gardens at No 10—are the elite secretaries at the heart of government. They hear all, see all, take a note of all and then keep quiet about it all—well, the really hot stuff that could get them sent to prison, at any rate. We are, though, privy to Ann's memories of taking dictation from Winston Churchill while he lay in bed, and Linda telling Alec Douglas-Home that Jack Kennedy had been shot, and Ann-Marie, who left the Garden Room to accompany Blair on his first vist to New York after 9/11.
Baggage Radio 4,11.30am The fourth series of Hilary Lyon's comedy drama about a group of fortysomething friends and their shifting cast of lovers, relatives and children. Newcomers should know that, while the characters are easy enough to differentiate—Caroline (Lyon) is Scots and her best friend Ruth (Adie Allen) is English — tragedy struck when the third member oftheir group, Fiona, died of cancer. When we join them it's a year later, and time to scatter Fiona's ashes. The two women are joined by the elderly Gladys (June Watson), Fiona's baby, April, for whom Caroline is now caring—and, newly returned from foreign climes, Fiona's widower Roddy. There—that should be enough potential for interpersonal chaos over the next six weeks.

Instead, the Britain's Got Talent final¬ ist found himself on stage as the sole British performer alongside the grandees of showbusiness at Jackson's memorial service. An expected television audience of a billion people had expected to see Stevie Wonder, Mariah Carey and Smokey Robinson at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles. But few had predicted the presence of Shaheen, who lives in Swansea with his mother, Karen, 39, and their cat, Muffin. Shaheen, who sang the Jackson 5 hit Who's Lovin' You, which he had performed on the ITV show, got a standing ovation from the audience as he successfully negotiated the first step on his way to global stardom. Al¬ though he does not yet have a recording contract he is tied to Simon Cowell's Syco, a division of Sony, as part of a three-month deal that all finalists on Britain's Got Talent sign. A source close to Cowell said that no decisions had been taken on Shaheen's future but the music mogul was keen to secure his services. ""With a billion people watching, it's safe to say that he'll be pretty hot property,"" the source said. Shaheen told The Times that he was approached by representatives of Jack¬ son's family on Friday.'T couldn't be¬ lieve it,"" he said. ""Michael Jackson has always been my hero and apparently he had seen my audition tape for the Thriller Live tour in which I played the younger Michael Jackson. It had really impressed him. ""It's an absolute dream come true. I can't believe I am among my idols, such as Mariah Carey and Lionel Rich¬ ie. It's been amazing hearing my name being shouted, and to be flying the flag for Swansea. It's out of this world and will only sink in when I get home."" Shaheen has just finished perform¬ ing on the Britain's Got Talent live tour, and had previously appeared as a young Michael Jackson in a touring production of Thriller Live. He told
Shaheen Jafargholi said performing at the memorial was very emotional
The Times: ""Michael Jackson's death was a complete shock. It devastated me, so performing at the service is a silver lining."" He said that it had been really hard to sing Who's Lovin' You while on the TV show tour. ""It was very emotional. Coming to LA to sing at the memorial service, I was a little bit nervous but who wouldn't be? I took it all in my stride. ""I haven't really thought about success in America — the whole thing has been such a whirlwind I haven't had time to think about the future. I'm just enjoying what I do day to day and can't believe I am on stage with these amazing icons. ""In the future I would love a career in singing and to be as successful as my idol, Michael Jackson."" Robert Phillips, 53, the headmaster of the Dylan Thomas Community School in Swansea, gave special permission for Shaheen to be absent this week. Mr Phillips said: ""We are very proud. Shaheen was asked specifically by Michael Jackson's closest family to sing at the service because they knew how impressed Michael had been with him. ""I got a call from Shaheen's agent asking for him to be released from school and then we were told why."""

Michael Jackson lay in his golden casket at his memorial service without his brain. The Los Angeles coroner confirmed yesterday that the organ was retained to carry out tests. The death certificate, which was signed by Jackson's sister La Toya, lists the cause of death as deferred. ""As soon as we are done with the brain, we will return it,"" Ed Winter, the assistant chief coroner, said. ""The last I heard, they are not burying the body yet."" It is still not known where Jackson will be buried. His body was trans¬ ported to the memorial service on Tuesday from Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood's ""cemetery of the stars"". The absence of a burial has revived hopes by fans that Jackson will be laid to rest at his Neverland ranch, or be cremated and have his ashes sprinkled there. ""I have friends buried at Forest Lawn and it's really, really peaceful, but Neverland is where he called home,"" Vena Knipple, a book-keeper and fan, said. The family may be waiting for Jack¬ son's brain to be released before burying him. They have reportedly filed for a burial permit with the vital records department in Los Angeles County, suggesting that the body will be interred in Los Angeles rather than Neverland, in Santa Barbara County. Ken Ehrlich, who produced the Jack¬ son memorial, said yesterday that the Jackson family had insisted on
LUCIO TAVORA/AFP/GETTY 1 * *> Jackson lookalikes show off their footwork in Salvador, northeastern Brazil
a church-style service — not a tele¬ vision show. ""We were kind of man¬ dated to bring Michael home in church,"" Ehrlich said on The Early Show on CBS. He said that he gulped when he learnt that the casket would be taken to the service. He said that Jackson's
physical presence ""lifted everything"" at the memorial. The memorial, described by the Los Angeles Times as ""sombre, evangelical, thunderous and hushed"", won wide¬ spread acclaim in the US press. The New York Times called it a ""religious pageant meets awards show"" and The Washington Post described it as ""part musical feast, part religious experi¬ ence, part examination of a man who seemed not a man, but something else his public was always trying to figure out"". The coroner is awaiting the result of toxicology tests amid reports that
Jackson abused prescription drugs, including the anaesthetic propofol, which is marketed as Diprivan. Police are reportedly investigating at least five doctors who prescribed drugs to Jackson. Arnold Klein, the dermatologist in Beverly Hills who treated the star for 20 years, insisted that he had not been questioned by police. ""I was not one of the doctors who participated in giving him overdoses of drugs or too much of anything,"" Dr Klein said on Good Morning America on ABC ""I was the one who limited everything, who stopped everything.""
He added: ""I say that anyone who makes someone an addict or gives a person potentially dangerous substan¬ ces directly to them to use, like pro¬ pofol, is a criminal."" Dr Klein denied reports that he may be the biological father of Jackson's two children with Debbie Rowe, who used to work in his office. m A version of the Neverland ranch is to be built in Chongming island, near Shanghai. It is expected to cost about 100 million yuan (£9 million) and will include a man-made lake, cinema and zoo. Jackson memorabilia will be on display. (AP)"

Dan Sabbagh Media analysis
o ffice slackers have, mostly, enjoyed an excellent decade, as each succeeding technology has created new opportunities for discreet timewasting at the desk. There has been e-mail, the internet, Instant Messenger, Facebook, Twitter and now, best of all, television. Now, of course, television hardly ranks among the technological breakthroughs of recent years, but i&atched over the internet it does, and that was how we arrived at a landmark moment for the medium last week when the office workers of Britain had eyes oniy for Andy Murray's Wimbledon semi-final. More than two million people tuned in to watch from their desks surreptitiously as the Scot slumped to defeat against Andy Roddick. That figure might represent only a small
part of the total of ten million viewers who watched Roddick win the fourth set, but a proportion of 20 per cent shows that TV over the internet is coming of age. And, despite shrill warnings, the web largely coped with the extra demand — high-capacity office networks are nicely geared up for staff using the network for fun. To a degree, of course, Wimbledon is exceptional; no doubt someone will be watching Toyah Willcox in a repeat of Cash in the Celebrity Attic at half-eleven, but you'd have to peer over a lot of shoulders to catch them at it. As the Ashes unfolds, however, with high hopes for a competitive series, the desire to see other weekday sporting events while chained to the desk may prove just as great as it was for watching Murray at Wimbledon. Newspapers cottoned on some time ago to the potential demand for cricket with live score updates online, along with live text commentaries, but moving pictures always trump text — if the feed is reliable enough. Sky subscribers can watch live via a password-protected Sky Player, and there ought to be somebody in every office willing to keep the feed running on screen if there are no
televisions in the vicinity. For the rest of us, there are three-minute highlight packages available at the end of each session at ECBtv, and on newspaper websites, too, which at least cuts down office timewasting to closer to an acceptable level. Radio does not do well out of this development — TV watching at work is wisely done silently, which, clearly, doesn't really suit Five Live. And this provides another illustration
of why radio has ceased to be a growth medium. Instead, the more valuable emerging broadcast rights are likely to be for daytime clips — delivered, perhaps, immediately after a 100 metres final or at the end of every session during a Test match. The other question is whether office television is any good for anything other than hot sporting occasions. Time Warner tested this
theory to destruction, it might be argued, with the flop of Office Pirates, a comedy clips site whose rationale was the belief that people would be willing to forward slapstick humour to each other via e-mail. It lasted six months in 2006 and failed to generate more than a few hundred thousand monthly users — not enough to keep the project going. Not much seems to have changed since; there may be several other comedy websites around, but as a mass viewing proposition, it is going nowhere. Sport, in other words, is the only game in town for office viewing, but then (apart from Britain's Got Talent) it seems to have become the last remaining source of national glue, or however you want to describe the ""shared experience"". # If Randy Phillips, the boss of AEG Live, the promoter of the ill-fated Michael Jackson tour, had been advising the Queen when Diana, Princess of Wales, died, there would have been no backlash against the Royal Family. AEG could have been blamed for Jackson's premature death, as, after ail, it was the promoter that signed the frail singer up to 50 dates and paid Conrad Murray, Jackson's
controversial physician. But Mr Phillips, setting aside the all-too-familiar ""we are a private company and we don't have to say anything"" refrain, simply kept communicating. He managed to express grief at Jackson's death, give a credible explanation for Murray's presence (""you don't say no to the king of pop""), spell out exactly how much AEG could lose, and release pictures, then footage, of Jackson in rehearsals. A week later, nobody could speculate that AEG would go under or that Jackson was not, at least apparently, up to the demands of touring. With nobody else having much new to say, AEG became the source of the story, not its subject. Mr Phillips is the kind of American who could sell you anything, which helps when you are promoting something as ephemeral as a pop concert. Just before the funeral, he was cheerfully admitting he intended to sell a DVD of the rehearsal footage, to defray the lost revenues from the summer concerts; nobody seemed to mind. Having made the commercialisation of grief so acceptable, AEG can fairly be said to have pulled off a PR triumph. dan.sabbagh(9thetimes.co.uk"

united Mates James Bone Michael Jackson had rebuilt his nose because extensive plastic surgery had left him with breathing problems, his doctor has disclosed. Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatolo¬ gist, said that he stopped him from going to a plastic surgeon and rebuilt his nose and cheeks using fillers, injec¬ tions to give the face more volume, last year. ""I thought he had a nice-looking nose... but it got to the point where it was far too thin. It didn't look natural to me,"" Dr Klein told the CNN programme Larry King Live. ""I rebuilt it, using fillers. He was be¬ ginning to look like the nose was nor¬ mal again. And that's all I wanted — and to regain the breathing passages of his nose, because there was a total collapse of the cartilage."" Dr Klein had completed work on the singer's nose but was continuing to treat him for severe acne and scar¬ ring from plastic surgery before his planned series of concerts in London. He saw Jackson for the last time three days before his death. ""Ijust was trying to get him ready to do the con¬ cert, because in the way he looked in his face he wanted it to be absolutely as perfect as it could be."" Dr Klein met Jackson almost 25 years ago when he diagnosed the autoimmune disorder lupus. He said
... «*'■_.
Jackson wanted his face to be perfect for last shows, his dermatologist says
that Jackson also suffered from vitili¬ go, an autoimmune disorder that affects the pigmentation of the skin, and that he did not lighten his com¬ plexion to try to appear white. ""Michael was black. He was very proud of his black heritage. He changed the world for black people,"" he said. The skin condition gave Jackson a ""totally speckled look"" all over his body, particularly on his face and hands. ""We basically used creams that would even out the same colour and we destroyed the remaining pigment cells. He had blotches but we evened out almost all of them."" Jackson had to be careful with sun exposure and began to use an umbrel¬ la to protect himself, he said, but Jack¬ son's face mask wasjust a gimmick. Dr Klein also revealed that Jackson had ""lost a great deal of hair"" as a result of its catching fire during film¬ ing for a Pepsi advertisement in 1984 and the ensuing scalp treatments. In an effort to cut out the scarring, Jackson's doctors used tissue expand¬ ers under his scalp. ""Because he had lupus, what happened is that every time they would do it the bald spot would keep enlarging,"" Dr Klein said. ""So he went through a lot of painful procedures with these tissue expand¬ ers until 1 put a stop to it."" Dr Klein also raised new questions about the paternity of Jackson's two children
with his former wife Debbie Rowe, who once worked in Dr Klein's office. The dermatologist said that he believed Jackson could have been the father.Dr Klein refused to rule out the possibility that he was the children's father, though, saying that he had once donated sperm to a sperm bank. ""To the best of my knowledge, I'm not the father,"" he said. He added that on learning of Jackson's death he immedi¬ ately called Ms Rowe and told her: ""I want you to get active and be the mother."" Dr Klein denied that he had pre-
scribed the star any drugs that could have killed him. He revealed that Jack¬ son had once gone to Britain for treat¬ ment for drug addiction ""where he went off drugs altogether"". Jackson's body has reportedly been returned to one ofthe locations run by the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood, awaiting burial. • Joe Jackson is due to attend a memorial service for his son in the family's home town of Gary, Indiana today. The civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will join him at the Steel Yard baseball park.

As my gelcito melted, 1 concluded that we still possess a desire for most kinds of monstrous pleasures, ranging from television reality shows to US soldiers torturing prisoners of war. Lake the circus-like life of Michael Jackson, for instance, liven in death, he thrills. Altera two-week trip to Milan, Rome and Florence to meet potential business partners, I descended on Paris. Working from my tranquil ""home office"" at the 1 lolel San Regis, I was expecting the opposite of distraction, hut il has been a struggle. Instead of concentrating on my responsibilities, I have simply marvelled at IheChamps Elysees. Exploring cities after dark is one of my passions. Looking out the window al the Kiffel Tower brought back memories ofthe i lowrah Bridge and its mother, Calcutta.
m On Monday 1 received a message from the Lithuanian Ministry of Culture confirming its support for my proposal to host a ""London in Vilnius"" festival. The British have never taken much interest in this Baltic slate. A.s a cultural entrepreneur running Liheralum. a British arts diplomacy brand, 1 intend to change this. The crown ofthe Luropean Capital of Culture sits on Vilnius's head, hence the idea to e'onnect with the city. \ftera coupleof meetings with the Spanish Consul-General in Scotland in May, I visited his home town last month to explore the possibility of setting up an event there. Madrid demonstrates a great dash. Enterprising, yet a liUiekuy -a merrymaking combination, if you ask me. 1 can foresee those affable Madrilenos treating themselves to an eccentric but colourfully intelligent cultural relations experience featuring the artistic csars of both these royal lands. The Consul-General encouraged me even further this week by announcing that seven regions of Spain will bring their arts and culture lo Edinburgh this month. If they can bring seven, it is time lo take the ""four regions"" of Britain to Spain. Guido Polito. owner of the luxury Baglioni hotel group, seemed enthusiastic about collaborating with us when we spoke in Milan. From Rome to Milan, invigorating Liheralum salons, if nol large scale festivals, could work beautifully. I cannot wait to hi ing our arts ceremonies to those capricious young Italians After meetings w ith several Venice residents
pyg in early June - including the city's ""solo female CEO"". Francesca Bortolotto Possali - I remain determined to create a Venice-UK cultural diplomacy festival with a strong literature programme. Mumbai has revisited my life. My last venture took place in India in 2007. Our PR dynamo, Meena Khera. asked if I would help to put Mumbai back on the international tourism and cultural map. Bringing world-class artists together, through a festival that will pay respects to those who lost their lives in the Mumbai attacks, will be the objective. From baboons to ambassadors, it has been an unpredictable few weeks. I remember bumping into an acclaimed musician named Michael one night in Florence, only to learn the following night that another musician, also named Michael, had died. Michael Nyman was in Florence. Michael Jackson was in Heaven. I believe the latter loved Michelangelo. Coincidences do not come queerer than this.

Audiences and users want to be proactive co-producers, not passive consumers. Collections ought to reach beyond institutional walls; interpretation techniques should engage with all backgrounds, ages and cultures. Scholarship and connoisseurship are vital, but the goal is to spread understanding and enjoyment. Governors and directors can support and nourish the habit and pleasure of informal learning; they must set the tone and pace. Boards should reflect the demographics they are appointed to serve and they should lead curators and keepers to become spontaneous sharers and excellent story-tellers. ROY CLARE Chief Executive, Museums, Libraries and Archives Council Sir, Nicholas Penny is entirely right to say that as a grand civic space Trafalgar Square has been seriously compromised, and that the National Gallery is suffering because of it.
Not long ago I was saddened to see that a segment of the public who throng the square felt that the outside walls of the gallery were a fitting space to receive their scribbled outpourings on the death of Michael Jackson. The lawns in front of the gallery are often strewn with litter or with the supine bodies of the intoxicated. But then that is the age we live in. No public space or park, however splendid, is considered sacrosanct. They are seen as places for entertainment, however trashy or damaging. To some this is seen as a wonderful ""buzz""; to others it is deeply depressing.

Homicide does not necessarily mean murder — it could mean a manslaughter charge against a doctor. Jackson, 50, died last month in mysteri¬ ous circumstances but is reported to have been taking a cocktail of drugs including the potent anaesthetic Diprivan, also known as propofol. Los Angeles police are investigating Jackson's prescription drug history and have subpoenaed medi¬ cal records from doctors who treated him, including psychiatric records. ""We are still awaiting corroboration from the coroner's office as to cause of death. That is going to be very dependent on the toxicology reports that are due to come back,"" William Bratton, the city's police commissioner, told the broadcaster CNN. ""And based on those, we will have an idea of what it is we are dealing with. Are we dealing with a homicide? Or are we dealing with accidental overdose? ""We've got very good investigators. They will be prepared to deal with what¬ ever the coroner's findings may be."" The singer's father said yesterday that
he suspected foul play in his son's death. Joe Jackson, 79, said that he was dumbfounded when he learnt that his son was being taken to hospital on June 25. ""I just couldn't believe what was happening to Michael,"" he told ABC News. ""I do believe it was foul play. I do believe that."" He said that a second post-mortem examination requested by the family had yet to yield answers about what killed his son. ""I did not know anything about the drugs. I didn't even know the names of them. 1 do know that whatever he was taking was to make him rest because he has been working so hard. ""That drug was supposed to make him relax and sleep. But anyway, he did not wake up. He never woke up. Michael died in his sleep."" The actress Roseanne Barr said in her blog that she had been asked to call Jack¬ son to discuss relaxation techniques. She also described him as a long-term drug addict. ""I was given his cellphone number the night before he died and asked to call him and I didn't, I was too afraid — I thought I would wait until shabbat [the sabbath] to call him and then he was dead. He wanted to know about meditation,"" she wrote. Sending her best wishes to Jackson's three
Tributes at the Motown museum in Detroit
children, she added: ""Their dad was a drug addict for many, many years. What makes a drug addict is someone who has too much pain in the memory banks."" A 2004 police document, obtained by CNN, alleges that at one point Jackson was taking up to 40 pills a night of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. The document cites interviews with two Jackson employees in preparation for his child abuse trial, in which he was acquitted. One ofthe employees, a security guard, later left his job after Jackson ""fell on his face"" in a hotel room. The guard said that he was not comfortable getting pre-
scriptions for the singer, the document says. Jackson's body is understood to be in storage in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memo¬ rial Park, Hollywood, which is owned by Berry Gordy, the Motown Records found¬ er, who helped to launch the Jackson 5. The family is said to be split on the Jackson's final resting place. His brother Jermaine wants to bury him at the Never¬ land Ranch, which could become a tour¬ ist magnet like Elvis Presley's Graceland. Katherine Jackson, the family matriarch, opposes the idea because her son vowed during his child abuse investigation not to go back to Neverland."

' ohn Blake is no slouch at rushing out books to anticipate public demand: this March, for instance, the day after Jade Goody's death, Blake's imprint released Jade Goody: Fighting To The End, a hastily updated edition of her second autobiography. It went straight to No 1 in the paperback bestseller list. Even Blake, though, has never seen a race quite as fierce as that now straining every sinew of the British publishing industry—to be the first to market with a title marking the demise and celebrating the life of Michael Jackson. ""It's extraordinary,"" Blake says: ""I've never known anything quite like this."" Just over three weeks after Jackson was pronounced dead in California, the first newly released Jackson book should be on sale today. Books that predated Jackson's death have already enjoyed a huge spike in sales, just like those of Jackson's albums. Sales of A 2004 edition of Michael Jackson: The Magic and The Madness by Randy Taraborrelli increased from eight books in the week before his death to 1,673 in the ten days after it. The Bookseller has reported that retailers have pre-ordered more than half a million copies ofthe new titles. One of those titles will be Blake's. On June 26, the day after Jackson's death, he was called by an author named Emily Herbert. ""She is good at writing fast and she was desperate to do a book,"" he says. Blake, though, wasn't keen: ""My initial thought was that there are loads of titles around, why do a new one?"" Then his sales manager called to say that two major retailers had contacted him and that they were ""desperate for a paperback"". Blake called Herbert, commissioned the book, and by midday had secured 30,000 pre-orders for Michael Jackson: King of Pop 1958-2009, which goes on sale next Monday. But Blake will be beaten to it by HarperCollins, whose Michael Jackson—Legend, Hero, Icon: A Tribute to the King of Pop has an official publication date of this Friday, July 17 —although Carole Tonkinson, the company's Publisher for Non-Fiction, says that some copies may be in the shops by tomorrow. ""Being first is the key,"" she says. ""We need to get that slot in the retailers. If our competitors sell them their Jacko book, then we're out in the cold. We need to be in the supermarket before anyone else."" Tonkinson's author, James Aldis, was given 48 hours to write 10,000 words, while the picture researchers were given a window of 72 hours to choose 250 images. Tonkinson describes it as ""the tightest schedule in the history of our company"". The printing presses started rolling last Friday and yesterday afternoon Tonkinson reported that she was holding one ofthe first copies in her hands. ""We're really proud of it,"" she says. ""To be competitive, we have to be able to move quickly. In a way we acted like a magazine or a newspaper, putting together something beautiful and enduring—at speed."" Despite this effort, the HarperCollins title is not favourite to take the chequered flag. Headline's pictorial offering (Michael Jackson: Life of a Legend by Micheal Heatley) is also due out on Friday. Carly Cook, Headline's publisher, says: ""I have never experienced anything like this. I don't want to sound cynical, but as soon as I heard the news I was already thinking about it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. You're talking icon status: there was Elvis and Diana and there's this."" Yet both HaperCollins and Headline will be beaten by Simon & Schuster, which has pulled off a masterstroke. Its
title, a warts-and-all biography by Ian Halperin entitled Unmasked: The Final Years of Michael Jackson, has been five years in the writing. Originally commissioned for a Canadian publisher, S&S stepped in to buy the UK rights only last week and the final copy (including updates from Jackson's memorial service, where Halperin was working for the US broadcaster NBC) was delivered on Friday. After a few hours for proof- checking, it was sent to the printers—and the first copies go on sale today. ""We believe we have the best book on the market,"" says a perhaps justifiably smug-sounding spokesman for the publisher. ""And we wanted to get it out there as soon as possible. We are the most up to date, too. This has certainly been the quickest turnaround that I 've known."" John Blake, however, is not convinced that Jackson fans will rush to buy Halperin's and Simon & Schuster's work. The book, which was serialised in The Sun yesterday, is far from a dewy-eyed homage (See box). Blake says: ""One lesson I've learnt is that people do not want to read books that are nasty, salacious or critical. You might read that in The Sun but you wouldn't go out and pay your £10 for a book with that kind of thing. [Our book] is a very affectionate tribute."" The alacrity with which British publishers have reacted to Jackson's passing is impressive and may also say something about the pressures they face to produce sales in a shrinking market. Compared with the Chinese publish¬ ing industry, however, the tempo of ours is more Earth Song than Smooth Criminal: the first Chinese instant biography —Moonwalk in Paradise—took a mere nine days to write, design, print and ship to the shops.

Screaming obscenities, a British sol¬ dier hauls the hooded Iraqi detainee off the floor and forces him to lean, legs bent, against a wall as other cap¬ tives, sacks over their heads and wrists bound with tape, groan in discomfort. The damning images, captured on an amateur-style video, were released for the first time yesterday at the open¬ ing of a public inquiry into the death of an Iraqi in British military custody in southern Iraq six years ago. The hearing was also told how a second detainee was made to dance in the style of Michael Jackson, a third was urinated on and seven others suffered varying degrees and forms of abuse. Gerard Elias, QC, counsel to the inquiry, said that he hoped to follow evidence ""up the chain of command"" to find out who authorised a range of banned techniques, such as hooding, stress positions and sleep deprivation, to prepare detainees for interrogation. Lawyers acting for the family of Baha Musa, the hotel receptionist who died after 36 hours in detention, doubt that Corporal Donald Payne, the sol¬ dier shown in the video, carried out the abuse alone. ""It is a question we will see through the evidence as it goes along, how high up it went,"" Aonghus Kelly, of Public Interest Lawyers, told The Times. ""I think there is a lot to come out."" The death of Mr Musa, 26, in Sep¬ tember 2003 was one of Britain's most shameful moments in Iraq, triggering widespread outrage and resentment. Mr Elias said a thorough investi¬ gation into the circumstances leading
to his death, as well as the abuse of nine other detainees, would help to offset the negative impact ofthe allega¬ tions, recalling that many British personnel gave their lives in the cam¬ paign in Iraq. Examination of the charges comes as the public rallies behind British forces who face their deadliest fight in decades in Afghanistan. The inquiry, which will cost about £450,000 a month, is expected to con¬ tinue until the autumn of next year. Mr Elias's opening statement is due to last until next week. In the most dramatic moment ofthe first day, wobbly video images showed six barefoot detainees leaning in stress positions against the stone walls of a small room. Corporal Payne, formerly of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, picks on two men having difficulty holding the pose. ""Get up you f****** ape. Now! Get up now!"" he yells at one man slumped in a corner. ""Get up!"" he bellows again, before pulling the man up and push¬ ing him back against the wall. It is unclear if Mr Musa is among the six. Mr Elias told Sir William Gage, the inquiry chairman: ""Even if one consid¬ ers only the video that we have just looked at, it may be thought to be entirely apparent that these detainees were being subjected to stress posi¬ tions and prolonged hooding."" Such techniques, he added, along with sleep, food and water deprivation and white noise, were prohibited in

However, a memo released yester¬ day suggested that there was confu¬ sion in the military as recently as 2004 over the ""Heath ruling"". ""PJHQ (Per¬ manent Joint Headquarters) was un-
aware of [it] until it was raised in the last two weeks,"" the memo read. Mr Musa died on the night of Sep¬ tember 15,2003, after a ""struggle"" with Corporal Payne and Private Aaron Cooper, the inquiry heard. His injuries may have been inflicted with ""a greater degree of deliberation than has hitherto been described"", Mr Elias said. The receptionist had been detained a day earlier with six colleagues after British Forces found a number of
assault rifles and pistols during a search of the Ibn al-Haitham hotel in Basra, southern Iraq, where the men worked. Three other men were de¬ tained later that day. While in custody, Mr Musa sus¬ tained 93 injuries, including a frac¬ tured nose and ribs. Pathologists have said that his death was due either to asphyxiation or a mixture of asphyxia¬ tion and physical injury. Mr Musa's wife had died of cancer at the age of 22, shortly before his detention. His young sons, Hussein and Hassan, are orphans. Outlining further mistreatment by men from the regiment, Mr Elias said: ""The detainees were hooded with hes- sian sandbags, they were placed in stress positions and subjected to shout¬ ing. There was also evidence that they were not fed or watered properly."" Corporal Payne became the first member of the British Armed Forces to admit a war crime when he pleaded guilty to inhumanely treating civilians at a court martial in September 2006. He was dismissed from the Army and sentenced to a year in a civilian jail. Six other soldiers also faced the court martial but were all cleared on all counts in March 2007. After separate legal action, the Min¬ istry of Defence agreed in July last year to pay £2.83 million in compensa¬ tion to the families of Mr Musa and nine other Iraqi men mistreated by British troops. The inquiry continues today.

America is understandably outraged that Michael Jackson was able to buy himself a personal staff of Dr Never-Say-Nos, who supplied with him the IV-drip of ""liquid sleep"" — among other hospital-grade drugs — that probably helped to kill him. But it can't have come as that much of a surprise. Here in the US, medical care isn't something that's administered when the Government thinks you need it. It's something you buy when you want it — as long as you have the cash. For Britons like me who grew up with the NHS, that can be quite a culture shock. Most jarring are the TV ads that treat prescription drugs like hamburgers or running shoes. After Jackson died, you could be watching a news broadcast about how he abused sleeping pills and it would cut to a commercial break for Ambien CR, a kind of supersized insomnia medication that releases a second dose into your system halfway through the night. Drugs companies spend about $4.5 billion a year on this kind of consumer-directed PR. But that's not to say I prefer the NHS. If you can afford a decent health insurance plan, America is a hypochondriac's paradise — seeing a specialist requires little more advance planning than buying a ham sandwich, very few doctors say no to writing a prescription and because money talks so loudly here, this is where the very latest technologies and procedures tend to be developed. Despite all that, the Obama Administration and millions of its supporters are pining for a system that bears more resemblance to Britain's. And given that the US spends an astounding $7,900 a person every year on healthcare (about twice as much as the UK) while about 15 per cent of the population go uninsured, it's not hard to see why.
But America should be careful what it wishes for. As much as Jackson's death was a lesson in everything venal about the US medical system, the culture of healthcare as a consumer product cannot be easily undone. And if they think that costs can be cut in half by government intervention while keeping that culture intact, I fear they're kidding themselves."
"July 15, 2009","['Deborah Haynes']","['News']","Hoon faces call to inquiry on treatment of detainees","2009-07-15","","Hoon faces call to inquiry on treatment of detainees","Deborah Haynes Geoff Hoon, the former Defence Sec¬ retary, could be called to give evidence at a public inquiry into illegal tech¬ niques used by British forces in Iraq to prepare detainees for interrogation. A list of witnesses has yet to be final¬ ised and his name is not believed to be on the latest draft. Asked yesterday whether Mr Hoon would be called as a witness, however, Gerard Elias, QC, counsel to the inquiry, told The Times: ""Possibly."" A second lawyer said: ""It may well be that an application will be made to call politicians. However, it is early days."" Lord Goldsmith, Attorney-General at the time of the Iraq invasion, is another possible candidate. The inquiry is looking into the cir¬ cumstances that led to the death in military custody of Baha Musa, an Ira¬ qi civilian, in September 2003 and the alleged abuse of nine other detainees by British troops. Mr Elias also hopes to follow evidence ""up the chain of command"" to find out who authorised a range of banned techniques, such as hooding, stress positions, white noise, and sleep, food and water deprivation.
In the second day of his opening statement, Mr Elias told Sir William Gage, the chairman of the inquiry, that the Government knew that its ""in-depth interrogation"" methods were suspect as far back as 1972. Edward Heath told MPs in March of that year that the techniques were not to be used without Parliament's ap¬ proval. ""The Prime Minister, we sub¬ mit, made it abundantly clear that his decision covered any future opera¬ tions anywhere and covered all future circumstances,"" Mr Elias said. Mr Hoon, in May 2004, however, told Parliament that British troops in Iraq had illegally been putting hoods over the heads of detainees, but that the practice had been stopped in Sep¬ tember 2003. Footage was shown at the inquiry of a British soldier screaming abuse at a hooded Iraqi detainee, while hauling him off the floor and forcing him to lean, legs bent, against a wall. It was also told how a second detainee was made to dance in the style of Michael Jackson, a third was urinated on and seven others suffered varying degrees and forms of abuse. The inquiry continues today."

Debbie Rowe, the mother ofthe two eldest children, is in confidential talks with the Jackson family about the future of the children. The court date for the custody hearing, which has been postponed twice, is scheduled for Monday. The New York Post reported yester¬ day that Ms Rowe would accept about $4 million (£2.5 million) for giving up her parental rights. Stacy Brown, a Jackson biographer and family confidant, told ABC News that a deal was in the offing. ""One family member said $3 million, another said $5 million. My guess is that it will be somewhere in between,"" Mr Brown said. Eric George, the lawyer for Ms Rowe, rejected the reports that she had given up custody for cash. ""There has been no agreement reached between Ms Rowe and the Jacksons,"" Mr George wrote to the New York Post. ""Ms Rowe has not and will not give up her parental rights. No deter¬ mination has been reached concern¬ ing custody or visitation. ""Ms Rowe has not accepted — and will not accept — any additional finan¬ cial consideration beyond the spousal support she and Michael Jackson personally agreed to several years ago."" The row broke as e-mails emerged casting doubt on Ms Rowe's desire to raise the children. Rebecca White, a close friend, showed the tabloid TV show Extra e-mails that Ms Rowe had written to her in the days after Jackson's death. ""'I'm not going after custody,"" Ms Rowe wrote to Ms White on July 2. ""These kids are not mine. They were never mine. They were always Michael's. I was Michael's best friend."" Three days later she wrote: ""My lawyer is telling me I have to take some responsibility about the welfare of the children. Do I want the kids? Hell no. Does it look good for me to ask for them? Absolutely. I don't want to look like the woman who gave away her kids and just forgot about them. Would Michael want Joe to have them? I think it would be the last thing that he would ever have wanted."" Ms White said that she thought Ms Rowe was seeking custody for

Debbie Rowe, above, allegedly told a friend she did not want the children
financial gain. ""The motivation is money,"" she said. ""I really have to be honest ... If the children aren't the ones she wants, what else will she gain from it?"" Ms White said Mr Rowe predicted that a secret deal would be worked out over custody. ""In one text message she had just said, 'Just wait until the Mth. Everything will be done after the 14th'."" she said. ""There's definitely going to be a secret deal. There's defi¬ nitely going to be a settlement that's going to come out of this."" Ms Rowe, a former nurse in the office of Jackson's dermatologist, bore
two children for Jackson — Prince Michael, 12, and Paris, 11. The surro¬ gate mother who bore Jackson's third child, Prince Michael II, known as Blanket, 7, has never been identified. When the couple divorced in 1999 Ms Rowe agreed to let Jackson raise them in exchange for a reported $5 million, a mansion in Beverly Hills and an annual payment of $900,000 for a number of years. Ms Rowe signed away her parental rights in 2001 but a judge in Los Ange¬ les reversed the order in 2004 after she raised concerns about Jackson's prosecution for child molestation.
Jackson named his 79-year-old mother, Katherine, as the children's guardian in his will. The will said that the singer Diana Ross should take them if his mother could not. Ms Rowe, who has been hounded by photographers on her ranch in California since Jackson's death, has threatened to seek custody ofthe child¬ ren. ""They are my flesh and blood. I'm going after my children,"" she told KNBC-TV. Ms Rowe told the televi¬ sion station that she and Jackson ""had an agreement"" but ""he didn't keep his end"". Chris Ayres, LA Notebook, page 24"
