The Princess and Dodi, on their third cruise in.little over a month, have been zipping about off Sardin - ia on a jet ski made for two. But while Dodi was pictured in a buoyancy aid, Diana was wearing just her swimsuit and a pair of ungainly flippers. In a week when there have been calls to regulate the use of jet skis after the second fatal accident this year, the Personal Watercraft Federation has gone into overdrive. ""Going out on a personal water - craft without a lifejacket is utterly irresponsible,"" froths Graham. Stu - art , the organisation's president. ""We are really glad that the Princess and her family are keen personal Watercraft users, but she really ought to wear a buoyancy aid at all times, if not for her own safety then as an example to others.

"September 01, 1997","","['Obituaries']","Diana, Princess of Wales, died yesterday after a car crash in Paris aged 36. She was bom at Park House, Sandringham, on July 1,1961.
Not since the heyday of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had there been an international "" icon to match Diana, Princess of Wales. Her picture on the cover of magazines was enough to guarantee sales worldwide, and no personality in history was ever the subject of more unremitting attention on the part of the paparaz - zi . In that sense, the fact that she should have met her death — with her new boyfriend Dodi Fayed — while apparently seeking to escape a motorcycle pursuit by p hotogra - phers carries its own cruel irony along with it. In an age when stars have be - come drabber and more ordinary, she achieved unrivalled glamour and respect. She developed from being a relatively unprepossessing kindergarten teacher into a stylish and beautiful young woman, al - ways well dressed, and beloved for her gentle and loving nature. The most successful princesses in history have been those who loved children and cared for the sick. The Princess enjoyed a natural affinity with both children and the sick. She devoted much energy to their care, in a way entirely in tune with the age. Her warmth and kindness found many outlets, particularly in
regard to those struck down with HIV. She was spontaneous in manner, happily ignoring royal protocol to bestow a kiss on a child in the crowd , and writing letters to members of the public signed ""love Diana"". Almost from the day she emerged into public life, the British people took her to their hearts. She brought to the Royal Family not only her very English beauty, but the enthusiasm of youth, combined with an innate dignity and a good - natured sense of humour. She was not an intellectual: neither a good passer of exams nor a noted reader. 3ut she possessed a canny and straightforward'form of common sense. She listened and she learnt, and whereas she may have found her schooldays boring, she relished her role as Princess of Wales. She loved fashion and dancing, and pop stars and groups such as Phil Collins and Spandau Ballet. In the early years of her marriage she was as excited at meeting stars like Elizabeth Taylor as they were to meet her. Though she was born into the far
from stimulating world of the con - ventional upper-class girl, reared in the counties of Norfolk and North - amptonshire and veering in youth towards the world of the ""Sloane Ranger"", her character had great possibilities for development, and develop she did, into a figure of international importance, confi - dent of her place on the world stage. She was given little support, it would seem, by her own family or that into which she married. Per - haps one of the reasons that the British public loved her as they did was that they always feared for her, and were concerned that she might be unhappy, while admiring her for being a fighter who refused to give up in the face of adversity. The world's press loved her, too. Newspapers built her up into the epitome of a fairy-tale princess. Occasionally they were fickle and turned on their creation, but it was generally more comfortable to let the world love her, and their onslaughts were accordingly short - lived . The press interest was relent - less , however, and it began long before the engagement was in any
sense firm. After her marriage, her every movement, her every outfit, her every mood, was the excuse for many column inches of press comment. She was a natural joy for photographers, being both photo - genic and having an innate under - standing of the needs of journalists. Her face could sell a million copies of any publication, and both they and she knew it. She adorned many a magazine cover by editor's choice, and once, memorably, that of Vogue by her own wish. In this great love for a public figure there was bound to lurk danger. When she flourished the press supported her , but when life was dark it deserted her. In the summer of 1992, the forthcoming publication of a biography by Andrew Morton, a journalist from the lower echelons of the trade, caught the attention of Andrew Neil, the Editor of The Sunday Times . Several weeks of serialis -
ation damaging to the monarchy followed. Despite complaints from the Press Council and pleas from the Archbishop of Canterbury, the campaign raged on. It could be seen as a major destructive force in the Princess's life. Diana, Princess of Wales, was born at Park House, Sandringham, as the Hon Diana Frances Spencer. She was the third and youngest daughter of Viscount Althorp (later the 8th Earl Spencer, who died in 1992 ), and his first wife, the Hon Frances Roche (later married for some years to the wallpaper heir, Peter Shand-Kydd ). She became Lady Diana Spencer on the death of her grandfather in 1975. Her Spencer forebears had been sheep farmers in Warwickshire, who settled at Althorp, Northamp - tonshire , in 1506. Cousins of the Spencer-Churchills , they included many connoisseurs and patrons of the arts. Having inherited a consid -
erable fortune from Sarah, Duch - ess of Marlborough, they were able to spend large sums on antiquities, paintings and sculpture. For many generations they served their Sovereigns, and the tradition continued. The Princess's father was equerry to King George VI and to the present Queen. Both her grandmothers, the Countess Spencer and Ruth Lady Fermby were close members of the court of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Moth - er , as were no fewer than four Spencer great-aunts . To her two sons, the Princess of Wales passed strong physical Spencer traits, con - siderably diluting the Hanoverian strain in the Royal Family. While the Princess's paternal ancestors were representative of the Whig oligarchy of the 18th century, she also descended through several lines from the Stuart Kings Charles II and James II, who were not ancestors of the Prince of Wales. Other paternal, forebears included the great Duke of Marlborough, Sir Robert Walpole, the Marquess
of Anglesey (who lost a leg at Waterloo), and the Earl of Lucan, of Balaclava fame. On her mother's side there was Irish and Scottish blood, with a sprinkling of pioneer New England stock. Her closest relationship to the Prince of Wales was that of seventh cousin once removed, through their common descent from the 3rd Duke of Devonshire. The Princess was educated at Riddlesworth Hall in Norfolk, and then at West Heath, a boarding school in Kent. She achieved no O - level passes. Later s. he attended a finishing school, the Institut Alpin Videmanette at Rougemont in Swit - zerland , for six weeks. Her child - hood was somewhat unsettled and unhappy because of the separation of her parents when she was six, and their divorce in 1969. She had more natural affinity with her father than with her mother. During the period after leaving school, the Princess worked as a nanny, a babysitter and a skivvy. She attended a cookery course in September 1978, and soon after this her father collapsed with a grave
cerebral haemorrhage, from which it took him months to recover. In 1979 she worked briefly as a student teacher at Miss Vacani's dance studios. Later she was invited by friends to help at the Young England Kindergarten in Pimlico, where she was popular with the children. She worked at the kinder - garten three days a week and at other times she looked after a small American boy. In London the Princess shared a flat at Coleherne Court, Earls Court, with three girlfriends. They found her a kind and thoughtful flatmate, keen on housework and evenings in front of the television, a lover of ballet, opera and cinema. She loved to dance and sometimes they returned to find her dancing happily around the flat. At the time of the pre-wedding press siege , these girls were to prove staunchly loyal allies. Fortunately, they were content to spend hours in each other's company. Years later, one of them, Mrs William Bartholomew, the former Carolyn Pride, was a source for the Morton biography of the Princess.
The Pnnce and Princess of Wales claimed to have met in a ploughed field at Althorp where Prince Charles was staying as a guest of Lady Sarah Spencer, the Princess's elder sister, in November 1977. The accepted version of the story is that Prince Charles and Lady Sarah were romantically involved, though not deeply so. The younger sister fell in love with everything'about the Prince, was keen to be Princess of Wales, and saw in him a challenge. She knew from an early age that she would have to tread carefully, and she never put a foot wrong. It was not until the late summer of 1980 that Lady Diana Spencer's name came to the attention of the world. The Prince of Wales was nearly 32 and the subject of his eventual marriage had been of consuming interest to the media for nearly a decade. Nor had he helped his difficulty by pronouncing that he thought 30 a good age at which to marry. As November 1978 loomed, the pressure increased. But he remained a bachelor, and there
were times when he looked a less than happy man. Lady Diana's appearance on the scene refocused press attention on the Prince's bachelor state. While a discreet and low-key courtship was executed in private, Lady Diana was pursued to and from work by determined cameramen and re - porters and had to resort to complicated manoeuvres to rescue the last vestiges of her privacy. Her subtle handling of the press earned her not only universal respect but the real affection of these normally hard-hearted men. At one point after she had broken down in tears, a note of apology was placed under her windscreen wiper. But the press pursuit persisted to such an extent that Lady Diana's mother wrote a letter of appeal to The Times. Later the Queen was obliged to complain to newspaper editors through her press secretary. The Prince proposed early in February 1981.
The engagement was announced on February 24, after which Lady Diana was better protected. From that day on she was surrounded by what she described as ""a mass of smiling faces"". Indeed the engage - ment was greeted with universal approval — though the Princess herself found her immediate pre - marriage days in Buckingham Palace both tense and lonely. The Royal Wedding took place in St Paul's Cathedral on July 29,1981, by the shared wish of both bride and groom. Prince Charles ensured that it was a ""marvellous , musical, emotional experience"", with three orchestras playing and Kiri te Kanawa (soon afterwards appoint - ed a Dame) and the Bach Choir singing. Lady Diana chose her favourite school hymn, / vow to thee my Country. Many heads of state attended , including nearly all the crowned heads of Europe, President Mitter - rand of France, and Mrs Nancy Reagan , wife of the then President of the United States. The King of Tonga required a special chair to be built to support his mighty frame.
A last-minute absentee was King Juan Carlos of Spain, because of the decision of the Prince and Princess to embark on the Royal Yacht Britannia at Gibraltar. The wedding day was such that for a brief while it seemed that all strife was set aside, the sun blazed richly and at the end of it, the police thanked the public for their vig i - lance , and the public praised the police, and, as one commentator put it, ""the world was a friendlier and easier place for everyone"". The honeymoon was spent first at Broadlands, the home of Lord and Lady Romsey, and a favoured retreat of the Prince when he had stayed there with the late Lord Mountbatten in his youth. Then they cruised on Britannia in the Mediterranean. A long holiday at Balmoral followed. Returning to London in October, the Prince and Princess took up res - idence at Kensington Palace and at Highgrove House in Gloucester - shire . These were their homes for the next 11 years. Their first royal engagement was a 400-mile tour of Wales, the first such visit of a Princess of Wales for 113 years. The
tour included a visit to Caernarfon Castle where the Prince, had been invested in 1969. The Princess of Wales was given the Freedom of Cardiff, made her first public speech and spoke a few words of Welsh. Despite the ever-present threat of incendiary devices, the tour was a resounding success. The Princess made an immediate impact on the world of fashion. The British fashion industry, long in a precarious state, was given a welcome boost by her arrival. Her style was fresh, ' attractive and original. She became the personifi - cation of current trends in British fashion, with felicitous results for the trade. The Princess soon revealed a penchant for outfits of considerable glamour. On her first outing with her fiance, she had arrived at Goldsmiths' Hall in a decollete black taffeta dress, a considerable contrast to her formerly discreet image, which caused the octogenar - ian Lady Diana. Cooper to joke: ""Wasnt that a mighty feast to set before a King?"" Her wedding dress with its lavish detail and lengthy train matched the magnificence of St Paul's Cathedral and her going
away outfit was chic and stylish. The fair fringe she favoured early in the marriage was widely copied for a time. Very soon the Princess was pregnant, giving birth to a boy, Prince William of Wales, on June 21, 1982. A second son, Prince Harry, followed in September 1984. In the early years of the marriage the Waleses normally undertook joint engagements. This was the period of the Princess's apprentice - ship . But it soon became clear that of the two it was her that the public most wished to see, and Prince Charles was to some extent reduced to a male dancer supporting his glorious ballerina in her pirouettes. While the popularity of his bride should have delighted him, it added a sense of pointlessness to his slightly frustrated life. Equally, he was irritated when he tried to make an important speech, and the next day the papers merely report - ed his wife's outfit. He failed to
grasp that one of the things the world wanted was a recurring series of images of a young couple enjoying a happy family life. He always appeared reluctant in such photo-calls , fearing that this dimin - ished the import of his more serious endeavours. The Princess, on the other hand, fulfilled all such de - mands to perfection. The respective backgrounds of the Prince and Princess of Wales were an additional challenge in the creation of a happy family atmo - sp here . She had come from a broken home , while his upbringing had been formal to say the least. His early companion had been his nanny, and he lacked any close involvement with his parents. The love of solitude to which the Prince adhered even after mar - riage , combined with his love of polo and hunting, inevitably left the Princess on many occasions with - out him. But both parents shared an adoration for their children.
E ven as the world re - joiced on their wedding day, the Princess was aware that she had not entirely captured Prince Charles's heart. Yet she always felt that she would win him. He most probably felt that the marriage was akin to an arranged one, and some have said that he did not enter into it in the same spirit as his bride. When the Princess real - ised that Prince Charles was never entirely to reciprocate the love she felt for him, she, like many moth - ers , transferred much of her devo - tion to her sons. The Princess celebrated her 21st birthday in July 1982, and that September she represented the Queen at the funeral of Princess Grace of Monaco in the cathedral at Monte Carlo. The Princess was soon busily involved in the world of public duty. As the years went by, she evolved into a deeply committed member of the Royal Family. She swiftly became better informed — in the early days of her marriage a Fleet Street editor was surprised to hear Prince Charles explaining to her at lunch that Chancellor Kohl was. the leader of West Germany. She also learnt the tricks of the royal trade, speaking easily to individual members of the public of all ages and possessing a good instinct as to what to talk about. Yet in the early days she seldom made speeches in public, and when i
she did they were of the most formal sort. As she gained confi - dence , she began to write her own speeches, delivering them from the podium with calm assurance. She spoke of the importance of the family in everyday life, the rehabili - tation of drug-users , and urged more compassion for those dying of Aids. When she and the Prince of Wales appeared together in tele - vision interviews it was not long before she was the more articulate of the two, leaving him almost monosyllabic , despite an earlier reputation for fluency. The modern manner is for mem - bers of the Royal Family to be actively involved with any organis - ation of which they are patron or president. Until she gave up most of her charitable commitments at the end of 1993, the Princess was never merely a figurehead, but served directly as fundraiser, pro - moter , chairman of meetings — and, of course, as public spokesman. She gave her support to an enormous number of charities, in a wide range of fields. Among her
key presidencies or patronages were Barnardo's; the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Child - ren ; Centrepoint; English National Ballet; RADA; the Royal Academy of Music; the Leprosy Mission; the National Aids Trust; the Royal Marsden Hospital; Help the Aged; and the National Meningitis Trust. An exhausting round of overseas travel was also a feature of her marriage. Her first big overseas tour occurred in March and April 1983, when she accompanied Prince Charles on a visit to Australia. The infant Prince William went with them. They travelled extensively from the Northern Tterritory to Canberra, through New South Wales, Tasmania, Southern Aus - tralia , Western Australia, Queens - land and Victoria. At that time the Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, was a committed republi - can , but he was forced to concede that the Princess was ""a lovely lady"". The Australian trip (followed on that occasion by 12 days in New Zealand) was the first of three such visits. In June they went to Canada where there was an outbreak of
""Di-mania "", a 1980s equivalent of Beatlemania. In February 1984, the Princess made her first major solo visit abroad, to Norway to attend a gala performance of Carmen by the London City Ballet. Arriving in the snow, she was at once dubbed ""The Snow Princess"". In the spring of 1985 she and the Prince of Wales went to Italy, a 17 - day tour which included a visit to Sir Harold Acton at La Pietra, and to the Pope in Rome. Venice was perhaps the highlight of the tour, and here they were joined by Prince William and Prince Harry. In October the Princess spent two days with the 1st Battalion The Royal Hampshire Regiment (of which she was was Colonel - in - Chief until she relinquished her military commitments on her di - vorce in 1996) in West Germany. Following their second Australian visit, they paused briefly in Fiji, and rested in Hawaii before visiting the Reagans in the United States. The White House dinner and dance was typical of the mid-Eighties bon - anza - style entertainment favoured during the Reagan era, and the highlight of the evening was when
the Princess accompanied John Travolta in a sensational dance to You're the One that I Want (from the film Grease), an experience which both enjoyed and which served to resurrect Travolta's flag - ging career. Other destinations during these years included Austria, Japan (where there was more "" Di - ma - nia "" ), the Gulf states, Portugal and France. In 1989 the Princess returned to the United States, this time for a less glitzy trip to New York, where she visited centres for the homeless and dying children in the Aids ward of Harlem Hospital. She was dubbed, in American parlance, ""Bigger than Gorby, Better than Bush"". There was a visit to Kuwait (where security was intense follow - ing the Salman Rushdie affair), and the United Arab Emirates. In June she and the Prince revisited Austra - lia , and in November they went on a Far East tour, taking in Indonesia and Hong Kong.
V isiting Nigeria in 1990, the Princess saw much suffering at first hand, and pointedly shook hands with the chief of a leper colony. In May the same year she and the Prince paid the first royal visit to a Warsaw Pact country, when they travelled to Hungary. In October the Princess went alone to Washington for a ballet gala and to further under - standing of Aids. In November she and the Prince went to Japan for the enthronement of Emperor Akihito (a visit sur - rounded by controversy in Britain). There were also visits to Brussels, to British troops in Germany, to Prague, and to Expo 92 in Seville. Besides the birth . of her two children, there were other events of significance in her years of mar - riage . She much encouraged the union between Prince Andrew and her friend Sarah Ferguson, and she was delighted when they married in 1986. For some years they remained close friends and confi - dantes , and it was a cause of dis - tress to her when that marriage came apart in the spring of 1992. The Duchess of York had ap - peared to be a good ally at court , never as glamorous as the Princess, never likely to threaten her place in
the esteem of the general public, but certainly her friend. But the arrival of the Duchess of York was, in retrospect, a damaging thing for the Princess of Wales, for she began to be tarnished by the new Duch - ess 's fun-loving and sometimes irresponsible attitude. The two may have seemed alike in character, but they were essen - tially different, the Princess being a great deal more dutiful and less interested in the perks. But the Duchess of York influenced her somewhat and it was during the time when they were close that the two then Royal Highnesses prod - ded their friends with the tip of their ferrule at the Royal Ascot meeting, one of a number of incidents that caused Establish - ment eyebrows to be raised. Each girl represented an alterna - tive fantasy for the young: to be like the Princess of Wales was to diet rigorously and undertake regular aerobics. The Duchess of York, on the other hand, made few conces - sions and her attitude was more one of ""Take me as I am"". In 1988 they were both in Klosters when
their friend Major Hugh Lindsay was killed in an accident skiing off - p iste with the Prince of Wales. This tragedy long dampened the spirits of .all three. For many years a small circle was aware of the not altogether happy state of the Princess of Wales's marriage. Much was writ - ten about this over the years, but the situation continued until The Sunday Times adopted the story in 1992 and blew it up to sensational proportions. The public was left with another dream shattered, and the monarchy's image was tarnished. The 1992 revelations suggested that the Prince and Princess of Wales had failed to establish a mutually happy rapport during their marriage. There were many obstacles to natural happiness . With nearly 13 years between them, they were almost of different gener - at i ons , he being born in the late 1940s, she in the early 1960s. The Prince was always of a serious disposition, inflexible in his way of
life, not noted for his willingness to accept change . The Princess was initially more light-headed , though she developed considerably in the first decade of the marriage. She certainly entered the union with a more generous heart than her husband, who did not disguise his anxiety that the taking of a wife was an additional burden in an already busy life. Despite her enormous popularity with the public, the differences in their interests seemed to divide them increasingly as the years progressed. Though they were both energetically and successfully in - volved in public life, the framework of their home life gradually eroded. He began to entertain separately. She spent more time in London , frequently away from Highgrove. Their problems were the focus of more attention than any couple could bear. Not only did they have to face their respective difficulties, but they had to do so in the full blast of media attention. The strain began to show. The Prince of Wales had resumed his i >
earlier association with a former girlfriend, Mrs Camilla Parker - Bowles . The Princess's name was linked with those of two men nearer to her age, the Old Etonian James Gilbey and the Life Guards officer James Hewitt. There were clear signs of marital discord during a visit to India .in February 1992, when the Princess spent time alone looking miserable at the Taj Mahal, and during a four-day trip to Korea in November that year, when the Prince and Princess, clearly unhappy in each other's company, were dubbed ""The Glums"" by reporters. By the end of 1992, speculation about the state of the royal mar - riage had come to a head, fuelled by the release of a tape of an intimate conversation between the Princess
and James Gilbey. There was talk of separate living arrangements, and a suggestion that reconciliation was now impossible. In December, John Major confirmed to the House of Commons that the couple were to separate. Separation did little to reduce public interest, particularly after the discovery in 1993 of another intimate tape recording, this time of a conversation between the Prince and Mrs Parker Bowles. In Decem - ber 1993 the Princess tearfully bowed out of public life, severing her links with most of the charities she had supported and begging to be left alone by the press. In 1994 Prince Charles admitted his long - standing and continuing relation - shi p with Mrs Parker Bowles in a television interview with Jonathan
Dimbleby. Despite her pleas for privacy, the Princess remained very much in the public eye. As she set about putting her life in order during the period of personal confusion that followed the separation — visiting gymnasiums one day and psycho - therapists the next — her every step was dogged by photographers and reporters. Yet her relationship with the media was always more com - plicated than she was prepared to admit. She may have been unhap - py about some of the press am - bushes , and about speculation on her association with married men such as the art dealer Oliver Hoare and the England rugby captain Will Carling, but there were un - doubtedly ' occasions when she courted the attention, in an attempt to influence perceptions of her marriage and its breakdown.
N owhere was this more evident than in her extraordinary de - cision — taken with - out consulting the Royal Household or even her own advisers — to appear on a special editon of the BBC Panorama programme in November 1995. She spoke frankly about her unhappy relationship with the Royal Family, her eating disorders, and her own and her husband's adultery. She announced her desire to be seen as ""a queen of people 's hearts"". On August 28, 1996 , the Prince and Princess of Wales divorced. Throughout her marital difficul - ties , the Princess had remained devoted to her sons. After the divorce, when she and the Prince were given joint custody, she con - tinued to invest considerable ener - gy in their upbringing . She was an adoring mother, and there were many images of mother and child - ren together, the most celebrated when the children ran to their mother's arms on Britannia after a period apart. The devotion was reciprocated, and her boys were a great source of comfort to her. After her divorce the Princess made a return to public life, associating herself particularly with the work of the Red Cross, and
taking a leading — and sometimes controversial — role in the interna - tional campaign to ban landmines. Earlier this year she auctioned many of her dresses to raise money for charity. She also seemed to find new happiness in her private life, spending much of the past few weeks in the company of»Dodi Fayed, who died with her. When she married the Prince of Wales, Diana said on television that she saw her life as a great chal - lenge . Realistic though she was at 20 years of age, she underestimated how great that challenge would prove and at what cost to personal happiness it would be met. The Princess made a lasting impression on the public. On the whole, they loved her; and even when she tried their patience, she remained a source of fascination. Outwardly shy, she had no lack of inner strength and common sense.
Before her marriage she cast her head down, hiding behind her fringe. After the marriage she gained confidence , the head came up, and she began to acquire that star quality that drew all eyes in crowds and preoccupied fellow lunchers in restaurants. That quali - ty , and that strength of character, saw her through her marital diffi - culties , and remained with her once the marriage was over. Soon after her marriage to the Prince of Wales she was given the Royal Family Order by the Queen, but she was never given any other honours, such as the Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, which she perhaps merited. On her divorce she assumed the title Diana, Princess of. Wales, . and remained a member of the Royal Family. She received various for - eign orders on state visits. Her two sons survive her. .i","DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES","1997-09-01","Diana, Princess of Wales"

Sir, My wife and I share the enor - mous sense of loss at the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, voiced byso many on today's television coverage. Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare , amongst others, expressed the view that she is irreplaceable in her work for various charities and in other areas of public concern, and surely in a direct personal sense he is right. Her untimely death will be felt in a very direct way, coming as it does at a time when she was beginning to establish herself as a major force in the world through the promotion of charities and other worthwhile causes. It strikes us that both her memory and her work could be perpetuated in a most appropriate manner if her family were to agree to the establish - ment of a trust in her name, dedicated to supporting the kind of causes to
which she felt herself drawn. Yes, she herself cannot be replaced, but if such a trust were to be managed by a group of those close to her and with a view to supporting charities whose aims were dear to her, surely this would be a worthwhile cause and a Fitting memo - rial . There will be many who would wish to contribute to such a trust, and it may be that a public figure who was close to her, like Lord Archer, would accept responsibility for co-ordinating its establishment. Yours faithfully, D. LEESER, 131 Marine Parade, Brighton, East Sussex. August 31. From Dr Christopher Gardner-Thorpe Sir, On this Sunday morning many are sharing the sadness of the families
of Diana and Dodi Fayed. We must not forget the family of the chauffeur too. Nor must we forget those of the media who were following the car. Whatever the outcome of the investi - gations , the media will feel some responsibility. The media alone cannot be blamed. Laws and regulations will not prevent public intrusion into private matters. Intrusion can only be profitable when public interest fans the flames. What is needed is a change of attitude in us all so that each and every act of undue intrusion causes outcry. Those who seek to provide public leadership — politicians, churchmen and others — as individ - uals can shun the limelight and lead by example. They can teach that too much public interest in private matters is improper and, perhaps most effective, unprofit - able .

From Dr L. A.

We can therefore place the responsi - bility for the death of Princess Diana fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the general yobbo public. Yours sincerely,

Shaw Sir, The Sunday Mirror today in - cludes a 40-page ""special issue"" sup - plement entitled ""Personal — Diana and Dodi — A Story of Love"". It con - tains dozens of photographs featuring Diana, Princess of Wales. I ask the following questions, not expecting any .replies: How much did the newspaper pay for the right to publish these photo - g rap hs ? How many of them were taken with the consent of those featured in them?
Is there anyone in the media who accepts that at least some of these photographs were taken in circum - stances which could be considered as an intrusion of privacy? Do newspaper and magazine editors feel the slightest regret, let alone responsibility, for the events which preceded today's tragedy?

"September 01, 1997","['Nicholas Watt']","['News']","LOOKING sombre but re - markably composed, Prince William and his younger brother, Prince Harry, left Balmoral Castle yesterday to attend church with other members of the Royal Family. Hours after being awoken by the Prince of Wales to be told of the death of their mother, the young Princes were driven slowly to the small parish church in Crathie where the Royal Fam - ily worship during their sum - mer break. Dressed in suits and wear - ing black ties, the Princes sat on either side of their father in the back of a black limousine as they swept up a narrow
tree-lined avenue to the simple church across the River Dee. The Prince of Wales, who wore a Highland kilt and a black tie, stared straight ahead , looking red-faced with blood - s hot eyes. The Princes were accompa - nied to the 11.30am service by the Queen, the Duke of Edin - burg h , Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, the Duke of York, and their cousin, Peter Phillips. The Queen wore a simple black dress with a black hat, while the Duke of Edinburgh wore a kilt and black tie. As she was driven to the church, the Queen smiled and waved to a crowd of local wellwishers and scores of
tourists who stood in silence. The Rev Robert Sloan, the Church of Scotland minister at Crathie, greeted- the Royal Family outside the church where wellwishers had earlier left two simple bouquets of flowers. During the hour-long ser - vice , which was attended by about 100 local parishioners, no mention was made of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Mr Sloan said: "" Every - body in the world knew what
had happened. Our business was to conduct a normal service of worship."" However, parishioners wept as they sung the hymn God Is Love His Mercy Bright - ens , and prayers were said for the Royal Family. Mr Sloan said in prayer: ""We remember all those who at this time need to know Your presence. All those whose lives are dark - ened by tragedy and grief who need to know more than human comfort and friend - ship . ""We pray for our Queen and her family, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince Harry. May they be assured of Your love; may they be assured of our love.""
The service was conducted by the Rev Adrian Varwell, a visiting Church of Scotland minister from Benbecula, the Outer Hebrides, who contin - ued with his prepared sermon. The two young Princes, who sat in a section of the church reserved for the Royal Family under a bust of Queen Vic - toria , listened as Mr Varwell illustrated his thoughts with Billy Connolly jokes and told of the unsettling experience of moving house. At one point the minister held up a. plastic bucket with a hole which he uses to feed his goats and sheeps. Mr Varwell said that the water which flows out of the hole is akin to people who waste God's love. At the end of the service Mr
Sloan, who was dressed in the red robes of the Queen's domestic chaplin, was over - come with emotion as the congregation stood for the national anthem. Standing in front of the congregation he held his head in his hands for a few brief moments. After the service the minis - ter paid tribute to the courage of the young Princes for at - tending the service. Mr Sloan said: ""They were remarkable. They were very good indeed, despite what must have been going through their minds and their hearts. They were very sombre and very upset."" The minister said he found the singing of the national anthem a particularly poi - gnant moment. ""When you sing the national anthem in
the presence of the Queen it does move you. The words mean a lot to the folk in the kirk. On an occasion like this it is much more personal than on an ordinary Sunday."" Mr Sloan described the Princess of Wales as a mem - ber of ""our family"" and said he hoped that the service would help the Royal Family to cope with their grief . He said: ""Whatever happens in the world there is still a tomorrow. The past can be put past and can be forgotten. There is a new life. From a Christian point of view we believe that life is in Christ and in the Christian faith. We hope they took this away with them."" Soon after returning to Bal - moral the Prince of Wales drove to Aberdeen airport
from where he flew to Pans. Shops in the Balmoral area shut yesterday afternoon as a sign of respect. Local people were joined in their grief by tourists who paid their re - spects outside the church. Olga Grainger, from Carlisle, who has travelled to Balmoral for the past nine years to see the Queen, said: ""It is the last thing that should happen to a lovely young woman like that. It is terrible for the boys."" Martin Ellis, 21, an English student living in Luxembourg, said that the best tribute would be to introduce an immediate worldwide ban on the sale of landmines. He said: ""It would leave a real mark if the world banned landmines."" Crowds at Balmoral noticed that the Royal Standard on the
estate was not being flown at half-mast . A Buckingham Pal - ace spokesman explained : . ""The Royal Standard is the flag of the Sovereign and is never flown at half-mast , even when the monarch dies. As the heir to the throne immediately takes over in the event of a sovereign's dying, the flag is never flown at half-mast ."" Wellwishers last night left floral tributes at the entrance to Balmoral Castle. One card said: ""To our queen of hearts. May you finally have found peace and happiness. You will never be replaced."" Another alluded to the Princess's reported dislike of Balmoral. The card read: ""You may never have loved Scot - land , Diana. But Scotland loved you.""

"September 01, 1997","['Alan Hamilton']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","The fates conspired to ensure the daughter of a doomed marriage with an unhappy childhood should never find fulfilment in a fairytale, writes Alan Hamilton
F rom the moment of her birth on July 1,1961, the omens for the life of Lady Diana Spencer were inauspicious. The stars were ill-conjoined for a boun - ty of contentment, fulfilment or even of luck. A memory that stuck with her throughout her life was the sound of crunching gravel: it was the sound of her mother's footsteps on the drive of Park House, the Spencer family home in Norfolk, as she packed he'r belongings in a car and drove out of her family's life. Diana, sitting bewildered and frightened at the foot of the stairs, was six years old. It was intended as a trial separa - t ion , but it was, in fact, the end of Lord and Lady Althorp's marriage which had been sanctified in West - minster Abbey 14 years before. Diana's overwhelming sense of isolation and' betrayal was com - pounded by her mother's departure coinciding with the sudden loss of her two elder sisters to boarding school. The sense of deprivation she_ carried for the rest of her life explains much of her facility for' physical contact with the sick and rhe dying. _ _ _ .. . ...
But even before her family lite was shattered, the fates were looking unkindly on Diana. Al - though by no means an unwanted child, her arrival in the world provoked a sense of anticlimax rather than rejoicing. Viscount Althorp was the heir to a family that had grown immensely rich on the back of the medieval wool trade. Although no longer in the first rank of wealth, they were still a family of substance. Diana was born with the silver spoon in her mouth, but the spoon held a . drop of gall. . «? As with all men of his rank and position, Viscount Althorp greatly desired a male hejr. But his wife, the former Frances Roche, had produced t\vq girls ; Then, at last , in I960, she gave; birth to a boy, John.

remark in later years. A male heir, Charles, was eventually born three years after Diana, but the Althorp marriage was none the less doomed. The divorce was acrimonious in the extreme, with Diana and her siblings pawns in an unseemly battie for custody. The atmosphere was further poisoned by her moth - er being named as the other woman in the divorce of Peter Shand-Kydd , a wallpaper manu - facturer . Unusually, Viscount Althorp won custody. .Johnnie Spencer, who succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father in 1975 and moved his family into the ancestral Northampton- / shire seat at Althorp, seemed to dote on his children, with Diana his favourite. But in the long run, his success in the custody battle direct- ed little happiness in the way of his youngest daughter. In the absence of a mother Diana was looked after by a succession of nannies, few of . whom stayed in the job for long.
One was sacked when it was discovered that she punished the children by slipping laxatives into their food. Another was dismissed for beating Diana over the head with a wooden spoon. And all the while, from her flat in Belgravia, the children's mother battled to retain some of their affections. Following her sisters to West Heath boarding school, Diana for a while appeared happy enough, if somewhat overshadowed in intel - lect and achievement by her older siblings . But even then a fresh , source of unhappiness was lurking' in the wings, in the shape of the Countess of Dartmouth. Diana had never cared much for Althorp, finding it cold, echoing and formal in comparison with, the much homelier Park House. But the family home became a great' deal more unwelcoming with the arrival in 1977 of its hew chatelaine. Step-parents are, almost by Continued on page 10

' The Lifeand Death of Diana, Princess of Wales: . .
Continued from page 8 definition, a difficulty for children, but Raine Spencer was in a class of her own. The daughter of the romantic novelist Barbara Cartland, Raine maintained the family tradition of larger-than-life personality. Her achievements at Alfhorp were many, including putting the estate on a sounder financial footing and nursing Earl Spencer through a near-fatal cerebral haemorrhage. But the children, particularly Diana and her youn - ger brother Charles, came deeply to resent her, bossiness, the hold she appeared to have over their father, and the insensitive way in which she ""restored"" their family home, selling off treasured heirlooms and paintings , often at giveaway prices. Diana's sweet nature held her true feelings in check, but only for so long . At a rehearsal for her brother's wedding in 1989, Raine refused to speak to Diana's mother, despite being seated next to her. Diana finally let loose her pent-up indignation and gave her step - mother a very public dressing -
down for her lack of feeling. Relations between Diana and her overpowering stepmother reached their nadir during Earl Spencer's illness. As he lay in a coma, Raine did her best to prevent his children visiting him, and they had to sneak in while her back was turned. Lord Spencer survived, but in the view of his children it was small thanks to his wife. It was shortly before the earl's illness, and not long after he had married Raine at a quiet register office ceremony, that a. chance meeting took place which had the potential to transform Diana's childhood of unhappiness into an adulthood of fame, fortune and — most important of all — fulfilment. How bright the omens appeared to be. But it was to bring bitter disillusionment and, in the end,
terrible tragedy. Diana first met the world's most eligible bachelor in the middle of a ploughed field on the Althprp estate, where a shoot was in progress. The Prince of Wales was at the time taking something of an interest in Diana's elder sister Sarah, arid the. ifrye' ar-bld Diana, unprepossessing in anorak and Wellingtons, had been brought . along simply to make up the numbers. She was not impressed, and many years later recalled thinking what a sad man he was. At that iirst.meering. ' there was no hint of the romance to come. But events began to move inexorably, although imperceptibly;towards a match. Diana's sister Jane married Robert (now Sir: Robert) Fellowes, then an assistant private secretary to the Queen, thus bringing the
Spencers into much closer contact with the Royal Family. And two elderly ladies began to plot. Queen Elizabeth .the Queen Mother was well aware that her grandson was a ditherer about women, and at the age of 30 still showed no sign of picking a bride and siring an heir. One of her closest and longest-standing friends was Ruth, Lady Fermoy, who lived near Sandringham and who happened to have a grand - daughter named Lady Diana Spencer . What part, if any, those two grandees played in bringing the couple together has never been fully explained, but it is inconceiv - a ble they did not discuss the matter. They undoubtedly encour - aged it, and may even have dropped hints in the right ears. T hat a romance was in progress was confirmed by an alert tabloid re - porter scanning the banks of the River Dee at Balmoral during the Royal Family's summer holiday there in 1980. Through his binoculars he spotted Charles in the company of a girl he identified as Diana Spencer;
from that moment, Diana became the most newsworthy woman on Earth, and media interest in her never waned for a single day for the rest of her life. The engagement sent the media into paroxysms of sentimentality. Diana was loved for being' so ordinary, for living in a flat and shopping at Marks & Spencer, She seemed beguilingly shy, completely devoid of the braying characteris - tics of the average Sloane Ranger. People found they could relate to her, whereas her husband-to-be 'as heir to the throne came from a different planet, one with extremely rarefied air. Few voices were raised in cau - tion , such was the momentum of the fairytale bandwagoni Yet it was an unlikely match. He was more
than 12 years her senior, serious of mind and with a Cambridge de - gree . He had had more contact with the outside world than heirs to the throne before him, but he still inhabited a world whose ways, customs, duties and responsibilities were far beyond the grasp of outsiders, He. was also in love with someone else. . She, on the other hand, was a fun Joying, kind-hearted girl with five O-level failures,. a pretty smile, good pedigree and virtually no experience of men.' Attheir engage - ment press : conference .. and photbcall, the couple .appeared rather solemn for a pair supposedly in love, but the. world merely put it down to Charles's ponderous na - ture and Diana- 's fright at such instant stardom. We now know
that far deeper undercurrents were at work. But nothing could spoil the sense of occasion of the big day. The country treated it as a national holiday, huge crowds lined the processional route in London, and the highly theatrical wedding cere - mony in St Paul's was watched around the world by the biggest television audience in history. Yet the very next day, on the first morning, of their honeymoon at Broadlands, the Mountbatten es - tate in Hampshire, Charles was seen by the watching cameramen to rise early, pick up a salmon rod and go fishing in the River Test. Diana, a naive girl just turned 20, had the highest romantic expectations of marriage . After the turmoils of her early life, she was in search of certainties; she needed a man to love,- and she needed to be loved. But, in a cruel reversal of the fairytale, she kissed her prince and he turned into a frog. . . The dream was not long in turning sour, even in public. From the beginning Diana had. been deeply distressed by the constant
attention of photographers, and she reached the end of her tether when she was pictured in a bikini five months pregnant on a beach in the Bahamas. But the stresses in private were infinitely greater. She knew from the beginning of Camilla Parker Bowles, but tried to convince herself, without much success, that .the relationship with Charles was ancient history. Her husband appears to have done little to hide his continuing affair, even appearing at.dinner during their honeymoon cruise on Britannia wearing a new pair of cufflinks engraved with two letters C. The public life into which she had been so suddenly thrust from a previous existence of total obscurity was a parallel factor which came close to breaking her spirit. After the eventual and inevitable collapse
of her marriage, she claimed that she had had next to no help or guidance from courtiers, or from other members of the Royal Fam - ily , on how to cope with her new existence,, and not even much from her husband. Above all else, she felt utterly and hopelessly alone. Yet somehow she still managed to present a brave face to the public, who little guessed that from the first days of her marriage, extremes of unhappiness and nervousness had. driven her to the eating disorder of bulimia. That she was so ill-equipped for her new life, and so out of her depth with no one apparently prepared to throw her a lifeline,- led within the first year of marriage to several half - hearted shows of attempted suicide, including throwing herself down - stairs and thrusting her wrists through a glass cabinet. ' v '
She was acclaimed on all sides as the ""human "" Princess, but down - to - earth human contact was precisely what she was lacking. The formality of royal family life was something she found herself unable to cope with. Dutifully, she quickly gave birth to an heir, one of the few events in their married life that appeared to bring deep arid genuine pleasure to both. Another son' soon followed and to the end of her life her children remained the only con - stant stars in Diana's firmament. But the public facade began to crack early. On official appear - ances together, particularly abroad; Charles began to show small signs of irritation that his
wife was catching all the attention, while he was forced to play second fiddle. Public and press were far more interested in her frocks than his worthy words. She dressed to kill, but in the early years at least she did not otherwise go out of her way to upstage her husband. There were other telltale signs that all was not well. She became painfully thin and on at least two occasions on overseas visits she fainted — plain evidence in hind - sight that bulimia was exercising its hold on her. But, for the time being, the couple kept the royal show on the road, travelling the world and receiving unbounded adulation wherever they went. The Princess won wide - spread praise for mixing easily f
with the poor and the sick; she achieved more than any amount of propaganda and medical education could do when she visited a leprosy hospital in Indonesia and touched the patients' withered limbs, prov - ing that the disease was not contagious and that there was no need for its sufferers to be isolated from society. That all was not well behind the facade was shown in"" the late summer of 1987, when Charles flew alone to Balmoral and stayed there for, a month, leaving his wife and children behind at Kensington Palace. Official spokesmen were forced into making feeble excuses about him being extremely busy managing the estate. The couple were reunited when \* L
they were persuaded to visit homes in West Wales that had been damaged by flooding. They arrived separately, left separately for differ - ent destinations and, during the few hours they spent together, they appeared not to exchange a single word. The marriage never recovered, and the couple spent more and more time apart, Charles burying himself at Highgrove and associat - ing with a set of local friends who included, inevitably, Mrs Parker Bowles. By 1988, Diana appeared at last to have come to terms with her situation, helped by two events. She surprised herself by how well she Continued on page 13 ' "" : . £ 1

herself with renewed vigour into unpopu - lar causes, from homelessness to Aids, that other public figures would have shied away from; Sometimes she invited public - ity , sometimes she went incognito at dead of night to hold the hands of the dying. Diana went in search of a new role, but never fully found it. She did, however, find a new man, James Hewitt, with whom she had an affair, but who in the end dumped her. The strains of public life,. far from receding , merely increased with the rising speculation over her marriage and her future. She found the constant press vigilance overany sign of a new man in her life intolerable. Once again, she was deeply lonely. Her feeling of isolation arid vulnerabili - ty caused her to make a tearful public announcement that she was withdrawing from public life, blaming constant press intrusion; She.did not retire from public
life; she merely tried to streamline her portfolio of patronages and interests, hoping to concentrate on a select few that would fulfil her desire to be a queen of hearts. Within hours of the screening of her BBC interview in which she both con - fessed to adultery and stated her ambas - sadorial ambition, she flew to Argentina to visit hospitals. The trip turned out to have been the result of a private invitation from a medical charity in Buenos Aires, with no input by the British Government, but she still managed to secure a lunch invitation from the Argentinian presi - de n t , Carlos Menem.

The formal announcement of the couple's separation by John Major in the House of Commons in 1992, the last straw in the Queen's annus horribilis, brought her no pleasure. She did not want divorce, hoping that spme reconciliation might be
possible. But, after a great deal of dithering and heel-dragging by her husband, ended only by a demand from the Queen for positive action one way or the other, the divorce went through last year. Diana was now. a free woman, but being the world's most desir - able divorcee is an awesome bur - den to carry. Conducting a romance is nearly impossible when the lenses of the world's paparazzi are trained on one's every move. She said recently that, were it not for her children, she would go to
live abroad permanently. Such a move would have solved nothing. Jacqueline. Kennedy, finding her - self the world's most famous wid - ow , opted for the security and physical protection of life with Aristotle Onassis. Diana formed a relationship with Dodi Fayed, a man whose wealth meant that he could offer a, degree of Onassis - slyle security with, his villas and guards. But those inauspicious omens were still haunting. Diana. She was clearly quite happy for the world to
know about her new beau, even though she had chosen.the son of a man who attempted to win respect - ability by buying Harrods but who had been refused a British passport and who contributed to the down - fall of the last Government with his revelations about cash provided by him to MPs. Had it been allowed to continue, the relationship with Mr Fayed would probably have ended in tears. Sadly, it ended in terrible tragedy . Even in. her death, the fates were unkind to Diana.

A SOMBRE Prince of Wales flew home from Paris with the body of his former wife Diana, Princess of Wales, last night to prepare for official mourning and a possible state funeral. He was greeted at RAF Northolt by Tony Blair, who had earlier spoken of his utter devastation at the death of the ""People 's Princess"" after a car crash that also killed her companion Dodi Fayed and their French chauffeur. At 7 pm, the'doors of the BAe 146 aircraft were opened and the coffin, draped in the Royal Standard surmounted by a single wreath of white lilies, was brought out and borne across the tarmac by eight RAF pallbearers, the silence broken only by. the slow tread of boots.

There was no ceremony, no words spoken. Prince, Prime Minister, the Princess's two sisters, the Lord Chamberlain the Earl of Airlie, the Defence Secretary George Robertson and Lord Bramall, the Lord Lieutenant of London, stood in line with heads, bowed as a brisk breeze chilled the dying light of the day. Twelve minutes later, the coffin had been placed in the back of a hearse and driven away to a private mortuary. After a few words of thanks, the Prince returned to the aircraft for the flight back to Aberdeen and his sons at . Balmoral. The Princess's body was moved to the Chapel Royalat St James's Palace just after midnight. - By then, Mr Fayed:had.been buried at Brookwood ceme -
tery , Wcking. His coffin, draped in black cloth with gold lettering, was flown back to Britain. on his family's jet and taken to Regeiit's Park Mosque where 600 rnpurners had gathered for a:simple funeral lasting just under ten minutes. The coffin was then taken to Brookwood for a longer pri - vate family burial service; The rererhony took place just be - fore 10pm, thus complying with Muslim beliefs which require that burialshould take place within 24 hours of:death. Mir Fayed's father, : the
Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayedv had been offered two plots and spent a few minutes making'his choice while the six-car funeral cortege waited at the cemetery entrance. Details of the Princess's funeral are expected to be announced by Buckingham Palace, today after talks with her family. The Palace is considering calls for a, full state. . funeral, normally re - served for heads of state, and was also consulting Downing Street. A state funeral would be widely welcomedby the public, but if that were ruled out the Princess would proba -
bly be given a large public funeral followed by a private interment attended only by close members of her family. Yesterday thousands of mourners gathered at Buck - ingham and Kensington Pal - aces and outside the Paris hospital where the 36-year-old Princess died, as political lead - ers \from, across the globe paid tribute to one of the world's best-known and most admired women. Radio and television stations scrapped their sched - ules and substituted continous news programmes, and even radio stations that normally pump out rock . and pop switched to more sombre music as details of the accident unfolded. Sporting fixtures were cancelled. On the political front, a temporary truce has been declared and campaigning suspended in the Scottish and Welsh devolution polls. The Scottish referendum due on September 11 may be delayed if it is felt to be too close to the funeral — a move that might necessitate a recall of Parh'a - ment , since the dates were fixed by legislation . President Clinton; President Mandela and Mother Teresa
of Calcutta all spoke of their personal sadness at the Princess's death,; The Arch - bishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey; said the world had lost a ""vibrant, lovely young person"" and Mr Blair seemed to choke with emotion outside the church in his Sedgefield constituency as he said: ""I feel like everyone else in this country today. I am utterly devastated."" Baroness Thatcher said: ""A beacon of light has been extinguished."" There was bitterness, how - ever , from the Princess's brother, Earl Spencer, and Mr
Fayed's father, who minced no words in blaming the media and paparazzi for the deaths. The couple whose . romance had dominated the tabloid press for much of the summer had apparently been trying to escape a pack of paparazzi on motorcycles when their car crashed, and Lord Spencer said from his home in Cape Town that every editor and proprietor who had paid for intrusive and exploitative phc*- tqgraphs of the Priricess, en - couraging ruthless and greedy individual to risk everything in pursuit of her, had blood on their hands.
A lawyer acting for Mr Fayed said that he would bring a civil suit as soon as a judicial inquiry into the deaths had opened. He did not say at whom it would be aimed, but he strongly criticised photog - rap hers hounding the couple and a spokesman for the Harrods owner said: ""There is no doubt in Mr Al Fayed's mind that this tragedy would not have occurred but for the press photographers who have dogged Mr Fayed and the Princess for weeks."" Mr Al Fayed issued a statement say - ing : ""This is an appalling and needless tragedy. The world has lost a Princess who is simply irreplacable."" The French authorities also had no hesitation in linking the accident to the photogra - phers chasing the couple. Sevr en freelance photographers — six French and one of Macedo - nian origin — were questioned all day by police and may face
criminal charges. But as the British Government faced re - newed calls for privacy legisla - tion to protect people in public life from unwarranted intru - sion , it was pointed out that the tough. French laws had failed to prevent the tragedy and Mr Blair's preference for self-regulation is likely to prevail. The fatal crash happened as the Princess and Mr Fayed were driven from the IJitz, where they had dined togeth - er . Their Mercedes 600, re - portedly travelling at up to 120mph, hurtled' into a con - crete pillar in a tunnel on the Right Bank Expressway near the River Seine shortly after midnight . Mr Fayed and the driver died instantly. The Princess, who had mas - sive internal injuries, was trapped in the wreckage for about an hour and a half before being taken to the Pitie Salpetriere hospital where surgeons tried for two hours to
save her. The only survivor was Trevor Rhys-Jones , a bodyguard employed by Mr Al Fayed, and he was said to be in a critical condition. Witnesses complained that it took the emergency services 15 minutes to arrive and that the one police officer on the scene had made no effort to rescue"" the occupants of the car. .

He was not a regular driver of the powerful Mercedes and had no known training in the specialised; high - speed tactics used by chauffeurs who double as security guards. The Prince of Wales, on holiday at Balmoral with the Queen and other members of the Royal Fam - ily , was woken by a telephone call informing him of the accident. When a further call confirmed that the Princess had died, he woke Prince William and Prince Harry and broke the news to them. Mr Blair, who had been told of the accident by the British Embassy, in
Paris, was among the first to telephone ' Balmoral to offer condolences. Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying: ""The Queen and the Prince of Wales are deeply shocked and -distressed by this terrible news."" In spite of the appalling news, the Royal Family went to morning service as usual at Crathie /Kirk outside the gates of Balmoral. Princes William and Harry, out - wardly calm, filed into, the small granite church along with their father, the/ Queen and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. At lunchrime the Prince of Wales drove himself to Aberdeen airport
to board a BAe 146 aircraft of the Royal Squadron to Paris, accompa - nied by the Princess's sisters, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale. The aircraft land - ed at Villacoublay, a military airfield 30 minutes southwest of Paris, and the party was driven at high speed in a convoy of ten vehicles with police outriders to the hospital where President Chirac was waiting with two of his ministers to greet the Prince. The men shook hands , then the Prince swallowed hard as they went inside. He and the Princess's sisters. were in the hospital for just under half an hour, spending a few minutes alone with the coffin in a
first-floor room of the casualty unit before meeting four surgeons and four nurses who had tried to save her. Aides insisted that the body had already been formally identi - fied by an embassy official and their decision to view the body was a personal choice. The Princess's face was reported to have been unmarked by the accident. The arrival of the Prince's party was watched by nurses, ancillary staff and patients who stood along the narrow avenue beneath two lines of plane trees, while others leant over staircase railings and looked out of fourth-floor windows. A small number of British and French journalists had earlier been
led discreetly through back streets to a rear entrance where they were vetted and admitted by soldiers as nervous officials, sensitive to strong public feelings about journalists in the wake of the Princess's death, ushered the parry in quickly. Even so, the journalists were greeted with howls of anger and shouts of ""assassins"" from the crowd. But the mood quickly calmed as the medical staff appeared, led by the anaesthetist Bruno Riou, and Alain Pavie, the thoracic and cardiac surgeon who both worked on the Princess in attempts to save her life. Pierre Coriat, head of the hospital anaesthetist unit, and Professor Jean Pierre Benazet, the
emergency orthopaedic trauma surgeon, were also there. At 5.06pm , the coffin was slowly carried from the hospital by four pallbearers, followed by two men carrying bouquets of lilies and gladioli. The Prince emerged from the building after the coffin had been placed in the steel blue Rivage hearse on which the blinds had been drawn. Silence 'descended on the crowd as he strode out, looking neither to right nor left, towards his Jaguar. The cavalcade then moved off— the hearse sixth in the convoy and the Prince immediately behind — in a hail of sirens and flashing lights. When it had gone, officials bundled
a black-draped coffin trolley and personal effects into a dark car and followed the convoy. In spite of the anti-press senti - ments in Paris, the royal convoy was followed from the hospital to the airport by two motorcycle film crews, with one cameraman stand - ing on the pillion seat to film the cavalcade. Few present remained unmoved by the sight of the Princess's last journey home. One Elysee official, who had been up since the early hours making arrangements with members of the Prince and Mr Fayed's. households, shook his head and muttered ""Quei J our ' quelle horreur"".","Priiiee comes home with ™^^ ' .

The tabloid, which ran a black-bordered front page that declared ""World in shock: Diana is dead"", devot - ed its first nine pages to the death. Inside, in a mixture of news and commentary, it traced the tragedy from start to finish, describing it as ""a grim fairytale"". In words ech -

Inside, in an obituary by Warren Hoge, its London correspondent, the paper said ""The death at 36 of Diana, Princess of Wales .. brought to a tragic close the life of a woman who had gone from being a shy young society girl to one of the world's most glamorous women."" The Los Angeles Times spoke of how the death ""brought a sudden, brutal end to a life torn with contradic - tions .

The death ... casts still another pall on the future of a British

The Dallas Morning News focused on a growing ""anger towards photographers "", say - ing : ""Worldwide reaction ... was swift, sad and filled with revulsion toward the p hotog - raphers who reportedly were hounding the couple."" Stephen Coz, senior editor of the National Enquirer, which specialises in celebrity gossip and pictures , said he stopped taking pictures last year from aggressive photographers as ""we are not interested in photos obtained that way "". People Magazine has fea - tured the Princess on its cover no fewer than 43 times — more than any other celebrity in its 23-year history. It denied yes - terday ever buying from paparazzi. There was a rush of mourn - ing for the Princess on the
Internet, with scores of web sites set up by fans being turned into ""memorial pages"". Ronald Dworkin, Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford University, said yesterday that the First Amendment ""makes it very difficult to have a general ban"" on intrusive behaviour by the press and it ""would cause tremendous con - stitutional problems"". He add - ed that without condoning harassment, ""people in Ameri - ca are more used to the idea that celebrity carries a price, the loss of privacy"". Public figures can on occa - sion get court orders to keep named photographers or jour - nalists at a distance, a device Jackie Kennedy Onassis once employed. But in Hollywood, which has dubbed the increasingly aggressive feud between celeb - rities and paparazzi ""Star Wars"", celebrity lawyers are
investigating pressing tor California state legislation to protect privacy. The move has been provoked by incidents, many blamed on British pho - tographers , who are widely admired by Hollywood ' p apa - razzi for their FleeJ Street - honed aggression. Such is the value of big-name stories that paparazzi often find it worth their while to hire helicopters to hover over, wedding recep - tions or Saturday night parties . Dodi Fayed counted Los Angeles among his homes and was remembered fondly de - spite the recent revelation that he was being pursued by more than a dozen creditors, land - lords and litigants.

"September 01, 1997","['Simon Jenkins']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","B astards , reptiles, vultures, vermin, sewage in the gut - ters of the press. If I were a paparazzo I would be keeping my head low today. The cameras that eulogised Diana's every feature, every movement, every activity, will be widely seen as having driven her into a wall. A comet streaked across the sky of public life and entranced the world. Such hysterical fame has reduced many to drink, drugs or suicide. Few have been so literally driven to their deaths; After the grief comes the yearn - ing for retribution. Nobody nowa - days dies by accident. Blame is sovereign lord to every misfortune and demands swift recompense. That appears easily satisfied. The photographers who dogged Diana and Dodi Fayed for the past two months appear to have trans - gressed all professional constraint. They were insistent, cruel and murderous. With them around, she had no privacy and no dignity. She was imprisoned behind a grille of flashing lenses. In a ghoulish rerun of La Dolce Vita, the lenses leapt from their bikes .early on Sunday morning to snap the last, most
horrific shot of all. Yet blame has not done with hunting. Behind the ghouls lie other denizens of this underworld. The editors, picture editors, circula - tion . managers -and bosses of the press have driven the market for intrusive pictures ever higher. Di - ana was simply the hottest property in the history of photography. A handful of fuzzy shots of her and Dodi aboard a yacht off St Tropez, syndicated worldwide, generated at least £3 million. This put a high price on the couple's heads. But photographers do not set this price. The cry of the freelance down the ages is the same: ""I shoot what I see. The boss decides-to print."" . Having found its target, blame simply demands that ""something be done"". Yesterday a chorus called for that something. The last minis - ter with responsibility for the media, David Mellor (who decided to do nothing); called for unspeci - fied remedies. Yet behind indus - tries are markets. And markets make less tangible targets. When - ever I hear someone complaining about the press ""just trying to sell
copies"", I wonder who buys these products. Whoinhabits this market place, if not readers? Buying salacious gossip about royals is like drink-driving and tax evasion: it is deplored in others but not in oneself. Yesterday I am sure many a sermon was preached from British pulpits on the avidity of the public for news of the rich and famous. The exorbitant price for the pictures which yesterday's Par - is paparazzi were seeking was set by an obsessive worldwide appetite for any news about the lady. If paparazzi are at one end of this sewer, at the other sits a salivating, prurient public. He among us that has no eye for such pictures, let him first cast a stone. None of this can stem the cry for action. That a public thirsts for intrusion is not reason enough for supplying it. Free markets need regulation. Damage needs redress.
There are many products which sections of society may enjoy but which public safety or the rights of individuals cannot allow. For years, British politicians and law - yers have been yearning to get their hands on the press. They now have a ^ case history par excellence. The hounding must stop. It is lethal. We should note first that the law has acted. The photographers con - cerned have been arrested. The harassing of motorists at speed and leaving the scene of an accident are crimes in all civilised countries. Trespass, theft and stalking are crimes in most. Chauffeurs-of the famous are trained in ""burning off pursuit"" and probably themselves break the law in doing so. That a law may not have worked in one in - stance — surely the hardest of all A.P. Herbert's ""hard cases"" — does not make it a bad law. However, the implication of in - terventions from the Foreign Secre -
tary , from Opposition spokesmen, from Earl Spencer and from others is that Britain now needs a specific law protecting personal privacy distinct from the laws on trespass, libel and slander. The press will be told that it has not heeded the warnings of successive govern - ments to ""put its house in order"". The familiar arguments will be taken down and dusted off. It is now almost ten years since the Calcutt Committee reviewed these arguments. That committee, of which I was a member, shared the view of previous inquiries that a civil law of privacy could not be effective. Such laws exist in France,
Simon Jenkins Germany, Italy and many Ameri - can states. The French is one of the toughest. Reformers should note where the past month's gross breaches of personal privacy occurred. All privacy laws tend to be effective in "" stifling small trespasses but not big ones. Calcutt pondered a graduated list of intrusions that reasonable people might consider fair ""in the ' public interest"", a phrase with many devious mean - ings . Those who are famous for a day, by being involved in accidents or court cases, soon return to obscurity. . Some professionals, such as doctors,. parsons and academics, appear more vulnera - ble to intrusion where their private lives infringe the dignity of their
profession. Most people feel them fair game. When we encounter entertainers, sportsmen and lesser politicians, vulnerability moves into the minu - tiae of private life. A rock star's marriage is regarded by most readers as news, even if it has no ""public interest"" bearing on his work. Drawing up a law to protect such people would be hard. Harder still is a statute to determine the rights of those who use the glamour of their private lives to promote their public ones. Prime ministers and royalty do this shamelessly. Most people, which means most juries, would accept that public figures sacrifice some right to privacy by reason of their office. But how much? It is absurd to expect readers to consume only
news fed to them by publicists, and not to hear if there is another side of the story. The misfortune of the fortunate has long been the essence of gossip, and gossip the essence of news. How far a newspaper should go is ultimately a matter not of fact, like libel, but of taste. Legislating for taste is notoriously hard. The present self-regulation may not show results in public — intrusion suppressed is by definition intru - sion avoided — but I believe it to be the only feasible course. Privacy is a choice anyone can make, even royal families. After the war, many monarchs decided to match constitutional diminution with personal discretion, for in - stance those in Scandinavia. The British Royal Family decided other - wise . From the 1960s onwards the
monarchy marketed itself as a family entity, and the media re - sponded to that invitation. I imag - ine that today more Swedes or Norwegians can name our Royal Family than can name their own. Even last year, when Diana fi
announced her departure from public life, I think she benefited from a widespread belief that she was now entitled to a rest. The value of her ""story"" would dimin - ish . Yet she later rescinded that choice and said that she would use her publicity value as an ambassa - dor for Britain and her causes. This exploitation became hopelessly en - tangled in her private life. There may be a sub-editor in Heaven who could have treated last month's flight from Dodi's yacht to the Bosnian minefields as just an arms control story. The, world media simply would not buy it. . No legal draftsman in a free
country has been able to produce a privacy law that protects only the privacy that merits. protection. There are laws in some American states that enrich lawyers and curtail legitimate press enquiry. The French law pays the famous (for instance, the Monaco royals} when a careless lens goes a breast too far. Privacy donations are part of the budgets of most French, German and Spanish magazines. Britain's proposed signing of the European Convention on Human Rights may enable judges to give some protection, for instance to minors and the sick. Such steps are unlikely to reduce the market price of royal photographs.
N obody could pretend that yesterday's horror is any - thing but a stain on the journalistic escutcheon. Yet I can - not think of a remedy. It was a ghastly accident, part product of the appeal of any news about a British royal. This* is a global narcotic beyond the ability of any one country to police. If British newspapers are. banned from buy - ing intrusive royal pictures, others will buy and import them. The only .relief will come when the victims of this market become less absorbing paradigms of hu - man weakness. Perhaps with Di - ana 's death, this process may begin. Stripped of her glamour, perhaps the Royal Family will become more ordinary — and less interesting. Perhaps royalty might settle back into a mode in which privacy is easier to attain. Perhaps, perhaps. These are b,ut silver linings on the blackest of clouds.","No law could have shielded her","1997-09-01","No law could have shielded her"

people and anxious to get to the bottom of things. I knew her as someone who loved life. She was deeply committed to people, to issues, to causes."" Dr Carey added: ""She seized the imagination of young and old alike. This beautiful woman was also a very vulnerable human being and out of that vulnerability and weak - ness , if you like, came lots of strength, her passion and her com - mitment to people. I think there's a sense in which we are all grieving because she expressed something that we all valued and loved."" Dr Carey, who was visiting Manchester, lit a candle for the Princess at the city's cathedral. The Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Basil Hume, wondered whether the nation had exploited Diana. ""Did we exploit this girl, if I can put it that way, who is now no longer here to be exploited?"" he said on News Direct radio in London.
THE Archbishop of Canterbury paid tribute to the Princess as a beautiful and vibrant woman whose vulnerability and weakness were the sources of her strength, passion and commitment. ' As sombre worshippers packed churches where muffled bells rang in solemn tribute to the Princess, Dr George Carey urged people to pray for Prince William and Prince Harry who, he said, would now grow up without a much-loved mother. Leaders of the Roman Catholic and United Reformed churches con - demned the apparent role of the press in the Princess's death, in ""making money"" out of her. Dr Carey, who had had many conversations with the Princess, said: ""She had faith in God, al - though she wasn't the kind of person who wore religion on her sleeves. There was a deep faith there."" He added: ""I found her a very intelligent person, very committed to
There are some very important questions to be asked."" Cardinal Hume went on: ""We need to remember that a lot of peo - ple have made a lot of money out of her over the years, because the photographs cost money. They have sold newspapers and, as somebody said, this was an accident waiting to happen. We will need as a nation to consider how we treat our public figures and what privacy do we give to them."" A congregation of 2,500 who flocked to a service at St Paul's Cath - edral were told by the dean that the Princess's life was a fairy tale that turned into a tragedy . The largely young worshippers, some wearing Aids ribbons, some weeping, hug - ging and holding hands, attended what the Very Rev John Moses called ""an act of prayer, an act of rememberance and act of love"". David Jenkins, Moderator of the General Assembly of the United
Reformed Church, said: ""Sadness will be coupled with concern over the apparent role of intrusive media in the tragic event that led to her death."" The Bishop of London, the Right Rev Richard Chartres, who was chosen to confirm Prince William, said that he was distressed and stunned. ""Her children will be particularly in my prayers as well as Prince Charles, her family and the relatives of all those involved.""' An unusually large congregation crowded into Westminster Cathe - dral for High Mass celebrated by five priests, including Monsignor George Stack, who said: ""There were 1,400 people present and you could hear a pin drop."" John Taylor, President of the Methodist Conference, said: ""She brought to all her work a wonderful warm humanity which won the hearts of people right across the world, often in the support of unpopular causes.""

"September 01, 1997","['Philip Webster']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","Philip Webster on how the Prime Minister and the Opposition leader gave voice to national grief
THE Princess was the People's Princess and that was how she would stay in the hearts and memories of- the British people, a visibly distressed Tony Blair said yesterday in his Sedgefield constituency. The Prime Minister was woken shortly before 2am to be told of the accident. He was still awake when the news came through from the British Embassy that the Princess was dead. He immediately drew up a press statement on the telephone with his press secretary, Alastair Campbell. Mr Blair, who liked the Princess and, according to friends, regarded her as a
""force for good in the world"", was deeply upset. Four months after his election victory, Mr Blair was faced with an unimaginable nat - ional tragedy and knew that his task was to find the words to express the grief of the country. He spoke to the Queen and the Prince of Wales at 9.30am to pass on his condolences and offer any help- the Government could give with funeral arrange - ments . When Mr Blair arrived with his family to read the lesson at the St Mary Magdalene Church, his voice broke with emotion as he gave his reac -
tion . ""I feel like everyone else in this country today. I am utterly devastated. Our thoughts and prayers are with Princess Diana's family, par - ticularly her two sons. Our heart goes out to them."" He had met the Princess just before his recent holiday, Mr Blair said. ""We are today a nation in a state of shock, in mourning, in grief that is so deeply painful for us. ""She was a wonderful and a warm human being, although her own life was often sadly touched by tragedy. She touched the lives of so many others in Britain and through - out the world with joy and with comfort. How many times shall we remember her in how many different ways — with the sick, the dying, with children, with the needy. With just a look or a gesture that spoke so much more than words, she would reveal to all of us the depth of her compas -
sion and her humanity."" The Prime .Minister added: ""We know how difficult things were for her from time to time. I am sure we can only guess that. But people everywhere, not just here in Britain, kept faith with Princess Diana. They liked her, they loved her, they regarded her as one of the people. She was the People's Princess and that is how she will stay, how she will remain in bur hearts and our memo - ries for ever."" William Hague was at his home in his Yorkshire constit - uency of Richmond. Alan Duncan, his press adviser, called him at 5am. Later, the Leader of the Opposition said: ""It has come as a great shock to everybody waking up this morning and a great sadness to all of us. She was a unique and very lively and attractive individual and so people will feel a personal sense of loss.
""But of course we should also pay tribute today to the tremendous work that she did for people involved with drugs, people with- Aids and other diseases, for homeless people, for young people in general, for causes such as the arts She did.a great deal of charitable and humanitarian work. We should recognise that, and salute that today. She was a shining individual who will never be forgotten arid I think that is how we should remember her.""

Both Mr Fayed and M Paul were killed instantly; the Prin - cess was knocked unconscious and given first aid by- Frederic Maillez, an off-duty doctor who arrived at the scene within minutes to find her ""moaning and gesturing in all directions"". He lifted her head off her shoulder to help her to breathe and then fitted an oxygen mask, but she died in hospital three hours later. The police disclosure that M Paul was drunk took some of the force out of the investiga - tion into the role of the paparazzi in the tragedy. But the continuing public anger was evident in the graffito ""Paparazzi murderers"" dau - bed under the Alma bridge by the entrance to the runnel, and seven photographers are ex - pected to appear before an investigating judge today after being held for a second night .
THE chauffeur of the car in which Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed had been driving at more than 120 mph while drunk, French investi - gators discovered yesterday. Henri Paul, deputy head of security at the Paris Ritz, had drunk more than thr,ee times France's alcohol limit for driv - ers — or the equivalent of one and a half bottles of wine — when he drove the Princess and her companion Dodi Fayed from the hotel on Satur - day night . Unconfirmed reports said that he had taunted paparazzi scrambling for pictures of the couple, saying ""catch me if you can"" before speeding away. The Mercedes S280 did manage to pull away from photographers on motorcycles as it left the Place de la Concorde, but as it roared into a tunnel alongside the River, the limousine came up behind a car travelling near the 30mnh limit. The overtaking
'Catch me if you can' taunt to chasing paparazzi
At least four are likely to be charged under France's ""good Samaritan"" law with failing to give assistance and leaving the scene of an accident. Photographers are said to have spent up to ten minutes taking pictures of the dead and dying before the emergen - cy services were called and witnesses reported that some were still swarming around the wreckage when the police arrived. They were then said to have blocked rescuers' path to the car with their motorcy - cles and jostled past officers to get nearer to the Princess. More than 20 rolls of film were confiscated from the seven men detained at the scene and these were being examined by police in a search for clues to the cause of the
crash. Other photographers evaded police and their pic - tu res are being touted around the world. One was published by the German magazine Bild yesterday . The prosecutor's office said: ""The investigation has al - lowed us to determine in a more precise manner the be - haviour of certain people who did not give the aid and assistance normally required in case; of an accident on a public road. The testimony of the surviving passenger will be very important, but it has not ,so far been possible because of his state of health."" Trevor Rees-Jones , a British bodyguard employed by Mohamed -Al Fayed, was the sole survivor of the crash. He suffered serious injuries but
although those were said not to be life-threatening , he is not well enough to be interviewed. In the meantime Mr Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods and the. Paris Ritz, has in - structed his lawyers to press ahead with legal action against the photographers he believes wre responsible for killing his son and the Prin - cess . He is planning the p ri - vate prosecutions in spite of the disclosure that M Paul — one of the most senior employ - ees at his hotel — was drunk. His Paris lawyer Bernard Dartevelle, said: ""Whatever the fault of the driver, we have a chain of events the origin of which was an offence commited by the photogra - phers . Mr Al Fayed will use all legal means to bring to justice
those responsible for her death. The opening of a man - slau ghter case seems the very least that should be done at this stage. If the photogra - phers hadn't surrounded Lady Diana's vehicle and organised the chase, the driver would not have gone so fast."" Michael Cole, the public affairs director of Harrods, said that while he condemned drink-driving , the photogra - phers had behaved like Red Indians surrounding a stage - coach . About thirty had gath - ered - outside one of the entrances to the Ritz while the Princess and Mr Fayed were having dinner, forcing the couple to leave by a rear exit. There they were met by M Paul — the standby driver — while Mr Fayed's regular
chauffeur acted as a decoy luring some of the photogra - phers away. In spite of the ruse , a high-powered motorcy - cle had deliberately obstructed the Princess's Mercedes as it pulled away, Mr Cole said. ""One of the motorbikes, a very powerful machine, was overtaking the car and pulling rightwards in front of it to try to slow it down so that the other photographers could keep up. ""The photographers were flashing off blitz lights into the eyes of the people inside the car. It was like a stage coach surrounded by Indians, but instead of firing arrows, they were firing these lights into the eyes of the driver who was just trying to get his charges away from them. One eyewit -
ness said it was not an accident: it was murder."" Of M Paul , a 41-year-old former naval officer who had worked af the Ritz for Hyeaf s; Mr Cole said: ""He has an exemplary record. He is a conscientious employee."" While he was deputy head of security at the hotel, he also had driving duties from time to time and had taken two driving courses run by Mercedes Benz in Stuttgart. These had covered anti - terror - ist and anti-hijacking tech - niques in both conventional and bullet-proof limousines. M Paul's body was found to contain 175 mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood and his drunk - en condition seems to have been apparent to members of staff at the Ritz who alerted the
photographers' lawyers hours before the police released the blood test results. The legal limit for drivers .in Britain is 80mg; ih' -France- a.level*of 50mg is a misdeamour and 80mg a crime. French police manuals describe anything over 150 as a state of incapac - ity that multiplies the chance of an accident by 80 times. An RAC spokesman said of M Paul's alcohol level: ""He would have been over twice the UK limit and would have meant he would have drunk the equivalent of at least a bottle of wine. In this situa - tion , the driver would have had no chance of controlling a big car at high speed in a confined space. Having drunk as much as he had, he would have felt immortal.""

"September 02, 1997","['Charles Bremner and Kevin Eason']","['News']","IT WOULD be hard to concoct a set of circumstances more certain to lead to disaster than the fusion of alcohol, ad rena - lin and machismo that app - ears to have contributed to the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, Dodi Fayed and their French driver. A late-night confrontation with a squadron of pillion mounted French paparazzi and their notoriously aggres - sive riders would have been bad enough after a hard day of cat and mouse around the streets of Paris. The.choice of a driver three times over the alcohol limit multiplied be - yond measure the iikelihood of disaster. The driver, Henri Paul, a former officer in the French Navy, had been . on ' two courses at Mercedes Benz in Stuttgart for drivers of both bullet-proof and conventional limousines, and had learnt anti-terrorist and anti - hijack -
ing techniques. He was described by Michael Cole, the public affairs director of Harrods, as a conscientious and responsible member of staff. He was deputy headof security at the Ritz, undertak - ing driving duties from time to time. The hotel said that he had been employed as a security assistant director for 11 years and would ""very often"" have driven VIPs around town. However, it was claimed yesterday that the- driver's drunken condition was known to Ritz staff, who are believed to have alerted the ^ photogra - phers ' lawyers several hours before police confirmed the results of blood tests. One of the paparazzi's solici - tors said last night: ""An anon - ymous person called our office at lpm today and said every - body at the Ritz knew that he was drunk when he left the hotel. It seems it was common knowledge. We plan to bring
this to the attention of the investigating magistrate as soon as we are able to meet him."" Mercedes Benz said the model in which the Princess and Mr Fayed died was ar - mour - p lated . Because of their extra weight , such vehicles can be difficult to handle . The Mercedes, now identified as a £58,000 S280, weighs about two tonnes yet can sprint to more than 120mph, a combi - nation of power and size that requires expert handling. Driving experts said last night that M Paul would have had no chance of controlling the limousine at high speed when so far over the alcohol drink limit. The chauffeur had been drunk at a level which would have, seriously im - paired his ability to drive safely at all, . never mind at speeds around IOOmph . Chris Howell, managing director of Drive Tech, which
trains drivers for the BBC, diplomatic drivers and chauf - feurs for businessmen at risk from kidnap, said: ""You can train, a driver all you like in every skill and for every situation but if he is over the drink limit there is no point. We stress that a driver must be 100 per cent fit with no drinking for 24 hours before major jobs. You must be completely alert to deal with any and every situation. To drive at high speed through a busy city you would have to be at the absolute top of your abilities."" Kit Maharajh of Browneye Security, who has driven the film stars George Clooney, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as the Prime Minister, said: ""The first thing I have to think about is to keep the people in my car safe and to avoid any kind of mishap or accident. The golden rule is that you must not drink. I don't drink.
You are taking a big risk when you drive through any city at that sort of speed."" The drivers said M Paul had been foolish to try to outrun the paparazzi, emphasising that remaining cool was vital when surround - ed by crowds of photogra - phers who had little regard for their own safety. : The Princess and Mr Fayed appeared not to have been wearing seatbelts, as required by French law. The Depart - ment of Transport estimates that 75 per cent of rear seat passengers who do not wear seat belts risk serious injury or death even in a relatively low speed accident at 30mph. European law demands that rear seat passengers are prop - erly strapped in. The Mercedes limousine was equipped with three-point rear seat harnesses and side impact airbags. The airbags did not inflate because the crash, though severe, was head-on and they would prob -
ably have proved irrelevant m preventing loss of life. On impact, the bodies would have been hurled forward into the front seats of the Mercedes with enormous force. .; At me .tiOmph JbilOOmph that eyewitnesses reported the Mercedes . was doing. as""; it entered the tunnel, the forces involved would have been beyond endurance, with or without a seatbelt, according to an expert yesterday. Gor - don Reed, chairman of the Choice in Personal Safety pressure group, ran a""comput - er simulation of the accident using 70mphas the speed at which the Mercedes ran head - on into a concrete pillar. He calculated the car would have come to a stop in 46 thousands of a second, generating a force of 70g, nearly three times that exerted on pilots ejecting from a jet. If the Princess had been
wearing a seatbelt, the pres - sure from the strapping across the shoulders and around the waist would have been the equivalent of almost three tonnes. That would almost certainly have caused severe internal injuries, including broken ribs and possibly a fractured collar bone. Mr Reed said: ""Seat belts are not infallible in a high speed crash of this magnitude. They would have been a mixed blessing."" Drivers studying pictures of the tunnel, where the crash happened believe that a slight rise at the entrance would have meant the car taking off slightly before bottoming onto its suspension in the dip at the bottom, making steering around the bend almost im - possible at speeds as high as IOOmph. ""At that point you coyld only put the power on and/hope — or abort,"" Mr Howell said. ""Clearly neither
was the option at that speed."" The RAC said research showed that there were more incidents of drink-driving re - lated accidents in France than in Britain. ""People over the limit do not fear danger in the same way that those driving soberly do. Over-the-limit drivers have their tension levels reduced and also their reaction times are greatly reduced, as is their judgment . All these factors combine to
produce a situation where an accident is just waiting to happen."" Peter Luff, Conservative MP for Mid-Worcestershire , said: ""The question that needs to be asked is how the mother of a future King was allowed to be driven by someone over the limit. It is all very well to protect people from the IRA, but we should be; able to protect them also, from being driven by drunkards , a much
more mundane but, as it turned out, fatal threat."" Lawrie Quinn, the Labour MP for Scarborough and Whitby, said the question now needed to be asked why the Princess did not have a proper police driver. ""This is one of those questions which we will not get an answer to."" He said that the disclosure about the driver demonstrated that people should not simply offer knee-jerk reactions.
Frederic Maillez, an off - duty doctor who arrived on the scene moments after the crash, reported yesterday that the Princess ""was unconscious ... moaning and gesturing in every direction"". He added: ""I saw that two people were dead and two were seriously hurt. I went back to my car to call emergency services and give them a first medical assess - ment before returning to the site with some of my equip -
ment ,"" he said on French television. ""I went to the aid of the young woman in the back who turned out to be Lady Diana. I did not recognise her immed - iately ,"" Dr Maillez said. The Princess's head lay sideways on her shoulder, constricting her breathing. ""I helped to free her respiratory tract. I lifted her head and helped her breathe with an oxygen mask.""

"September 02, 1997","['Bill Frost']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","The violent death of Diana, Princess of Wales , has left mil - lions grieving for her and feeling sympathy for her sons , the young Princes Wil - liam and Harry, left behind to face life without a mother's love. Blanket coverage of the tragedy may also, have traumatised thousands of children and adolescents who have gone through their par - ents ' divorce and now fear an even greater loss of stability — that they, too, will have a parent taken from them for ever . Dr Dora Black, a consultant psychiatrist specialising in the emotional and ""traumatic stress disorder problems of the young, gives a warning that the death of the Princess will have produced an emotional effect wider than the immedi - ate sense of bereavement, and one which will require imme - diate attention.
The Princess's death may haunt other children whose parents are divorced. Bill Frost reports
""After this appalling acci - dent , children from a single - parent family — made that way by divorce — who have witnessed the separation of their parents will themselves be worried about their moth - ers . There will be a consider - able upsurge in anxiety. ""No one has been left un - moved by this event, the tragic and early death of Diana, but
for the young and vulnerable it is particularly unsettling. Many will be worried, co n - sciously or otherwise, that their mothers. too, will be killed in a car accident or other tragedy — that they will be left without any parents at all."" Dr Black says that younger children may want to follow their mothers everywhere — even into the lavatory. ""The parent must understand that this is a temporary but very serious reaction to what has happened and the coverage of the story; if one very high - profile mother is taken from her children, why should it not happen to them?""
O lder , children and adolescents whose parents are sepa - rated will also expe - rience an increase in anxiety at the prospect of bereavement. ""They may well worry a great deal but not voice their fears,"" says Dr Black. ""That concern will manifest itself in disobedience, dis - agreeable behaviour and moodiness. The unconscious rationale behind the behav - iou r is 'She may well reject me [by dying], so I will reject her first' ."" Parents still together may also find their children dis - playing similar symptoms
after exposure to the inescap - able coverage of Diana's death. They too must emphasise that such events, though tragic, are fortunately rare, says Dr Black. ""Tell your children that you will look after yourselves and always drive carefully. Di - ana 's death was . horrible but it does not mean : that every mother will die that way. . ""I cannot , stress highly enough though that parents, particularly divorced parents, should anticipate these prob - . lems. They ought to start talking out their children's insecurities.now."" Dr Black is concerned that
any child returning to school in such circumstances should be treated with care and compassion. ""The death should be ac - knowledged , not swept under the carpet. Pupils and teachers should be able to approach and say 'I am really sorry your mother has died'. ""Most importantly there should be no bullying or teasing; headmasters and oth - er teachers must ensure that doesn't happen. I'm afraid such behaviour is not un - known and no child should be exposed to that at such a sensitive time, particularly when violent bereavement is concerned.
""There is a higher risk of psychological damage after sudden bereavement, so any child should be given help in talking about their mother to
people around them, people they feel cared as much for their mother as they did. ""Again , talking in general terms, they must be allowed to attend the funeral and to view the body — that helps in the process of acknowl - edging that she really is dead. ""At the funeral it - self they must be supported by some - one close. It does not necessarily have to be a parent — it could be a- nanny or family friend."" Another child psy - chiatrist , who would speak about the Princes only on the condition of anonym - ity , said yesterday that their ordeal
might be harder to face given ""the professional dignity and emotional control of the family they had been born into"" . He told The Times: 'That is not a criticism, many families find it hard to express their deepest feelings at a time like this. However, when you are constantly in the public view, that makes the image of stoic dignity even more difficult to maintainand the pain of private grief even more heavy. ""No royal house welcomes tears from the main players at a state funeral. Ironically, of course, Diana herself would have been the first to brealc that rule; she allowed her emotions free expression.""
Dr Stephen Palmer, director of the Centre for Stress Man - agement , in southeast London, said yesterday that among adults faced with such trage - dy , those left behind would experience a complex gamut of emotions. Those emotions might be all the more difficult to acknowledge when the equation was complicated by the element of divorce. ""I think the manifestations of normal grief run through sadness, anger, hostility, anxi - ety and self-reproach — but that's in a normal set of circumstances. ""If they have been exacer - bated for some reason — say you are haunted by the feeling 'T should not have done that'
and believe that others judge you as the guilty party for some reason — then guilt and self-reproach increase. ""In some cases that can lead to . members of the surviving family blaming themselves for what has happened to the deceased . That leads to a very negative outlook on life, and on oneself, along with feelings of helplessness, loneliness and fatigue."" Children and adolescents tragically deprived of a parent, having already undergone the trauma of witnessing their mother and father getting divorced, could give the in> pression of coming to terms with bereavement. However,
the most trivial event could send them plunging back into numb disbelief. ""The key issue here is ensur - ing that substantial care is given to the child or adolescent after the death of a parent. Someone, ideally the surviv - ing parent, must take over that role as best he or she can."" However, what course of action lies open should that person be emotionally colder or more withdrawn than the dead parent? ""They must ei - ther make the effort, or some - one who can attempt the task must step into the breach,"" says Dr Palmer. ""In many extended families there is such a support system
available . But when it is not, that void must be filled, say by a favourite nanny or a relative. All the children want is stabil - ity and, sadly, the surviving parent is not always able to provide that."" For the children, ma inte - nance of ""routine , the appear - ance of life going on as normal"" is central to swift acknowledgement and accep - tance of the permanence of death. ""They must accept that they will never see that person again and still be able to grieve at the same time."" Dr Palmer, a psychologist, said the princes should be allowed to mourn . in private. ""Grief is a very personal thing.
Unfortunately, there will be intrusion by press photogra - p hers and camera crews at the moment when they should be given the time and space to deal with this tragedy away from the limelight."" Susan Wallbank, a counsel - lor for the bereavement care organisation Cruse, of which the Queen is a patron, spoke yesterday of the problems faced by any family confront - ing the loss of a member already separated from them by divorce. ""I stress I am talking gener - ally here — one is never judgmental, one never talks of dysfunctional families, it is most unhelpful. But in any family, every family, guilt is
the most remarkable feature of the griev - ing process. Those left behind think, 'How could I have made things' differ - e nt ', 'If only I could turn the clock back'. That is true of the highest and lowest families in the land. ""Both father and mother brought a special set of qualities which their children came to recognise and rely upon. One could be warm, the other a bit more dis - tant . That's the way people are, it doesn't suggest one is right or the other wrong to be that way. ""The one left be - hind must learn to replicate the qualities of the one who has
gone. The younger the child, the greater the need for the father to be as warm and loving as the mother who has been taken from them. ""Although the loss is also horrific for the adult, he or she can still open up his or her own history and find the emotions given at childhood. They can cast themselves in a joint role. ""People can change; and death changes everything. While everything is permissi - ble in the early stages of grief, the parent whosurvives has a duty to keep the family intact, to alter if necessary — any - thing to ensure the survival of the family.""

' I paused — in .some surprise. We had spoken for barely five minutes. It was already clear that this was not to be a wide-ranging conversa - tion . Whatever else is said about Diana, Princess of Wales, in this dreadful week, let it not be saiS that she jacked sophistication about the media, her use of it and its use of her.. She could be as ""on message"" as the most disciplined determined New; Labour apparatchik. She was as charming that day as everyone always says that she is. But she did not move outside the lines that she had most clearly defined. .:. ' T nside those lines were the very aspects of her. life which most ' people keep outside in discus -
JL sion with newspaper editors — her husband; his mistress, her in-laws , her own fragile sense of herself. Within minutes I felt I was talking to someone I knew. By the time that she had toyed her way through her foie gras and lamb, I knew things about her that I did not know about my closest-friends . I should admit now that, before this lunch, I had a very low level of interest in what I would have called at that time ""our Royal soap opera"". I assumed, wrongly, that a'large amount of the journalism generat - ed by the juvenile Windsors was misleading, false, fourth-hand , or worse. I did not immediately accept the analysis which she set out with such care. But this was long before the Panorama interview. To read what seemed like recycled gossip about iconic characters was. one thing. To hear so .directly from the centralplayer was quite another. I
From the pavement where I was standing, in :fhe covered pathway to the restaurant in Park Lane, there was not a paparazzo to be seen. Yet, according to the manager who had brought us the warning message, there was a pack of them out there. Inside, sitting at the table where we had just finished lunch, was a worried waitress and the Princess of Wales. Outside, I was left looking through the haze of fumes to Marble Arch and back, unable to see the slightest bulge of Japanese plastic, the faintest glint of lens, the least. sound of Italian-speaking , motorbike-driving paparazzo. Somewhat. shamefacedly, I re - turned to the table. Just as a precaution The Times driver was contacted and sent round to a side entrance. The Princess continued calmly to sip her bottled water and talk about herself, her husband, his family, her work, her problems and the complex cat's-cradle which the media wove between them all.
The date was May 18, 1994, not the worst of days for the then wife of the Prince of Wales but not a good day either. Even when she arrived at the restaurant, she had worn a quick smile and a bad-news frown. There was no preamble. Her face was stretched into the faintest pattern of lines and circles and her question was wholly rhetorical: ""Well , do we know how this particular story got into the papers this morning?"" She did know. The subject of the day was the Princess's ""grooming expenses"" which, according to. the Daily . Mail and others, were higher ' than £3,000 a week . ""My husband said it at a dinner parry last week, where it got to Ross Benson and to Nigel Dempster and now there's all this stuff,"" she complained. Most of the ""stuff"" had been helpful hints from journalists about how much her various suits and shoes might have cost and how readers might replicate them at lower prices. ""No one mentions all
presume that many others in our business had the same experience. The Princess complained of how her husband's family divided the charity world between its long - estabjished members — a Duchess for hospices, a Duke, for animals, a Princess for children. Occasionally twisting the stem of an empty glass, she described how hard it was for her to enter where her real interests led and where the real demand for her was so high. . I had not expected her to be fond of the Dimbleby biography of her husband. But it was different again to hear her views directly. ""Did you know' that it originally was sup - posed to contain nothingabout our relationship at, all? How were readers supposed to think that the children came? By immaculate conception ?"" , .
ought to be struck off for pretend - ing to use their medical training on a patient they have never met? The boys, after their mother's catastrophe, deserve better. In a perfect world, every editor — from Smash Hits XoPanorama — would promise from this moment to leave them entirely alone, photograp hi - cally and journalistically, while they grow up* No insulting p lati - tudes about ""the grieving process"", no opera glasses trained on their faces at the funeral, and in months to come no pictures captioned ""Sad Harry learns to smile again"". No lifestyle features, no gatefold p in - ups for the bedrooms of moronic teenage girls, no. reporting-of their inevitable embarrassing stumbles on the road to adulthood. In two years' time it shouldbe .possible to pass the Princes in the street and not to recognise therri. I feel strongly about this at the
moment, having spent the week before the tragedy on a sailing boat with two 14-year-old boys. Both are as adamant as Ayatollahs that Diana*s sons deserve and need a total, prolonged, guaranteed news blackout. . ""And be careful,"" one Ubby Curves admonished me, ""that when you write your piece saying that, you don't write anything about them by accident."" So I hardly dare observe that Prince William is already known to dislike publicity and
would most likely welcome entire freedom from it, even more than ordinary boys like them. Of course it is not a perfect world but a commercial one. Despite the emotion of this week, it is ludicrous - ly unlikely that any editor will voluntarily and unilaterally give up such a fascinating subject; not if there is a risk that competing editors will not. So what we need, in this unprecedented situation, is an unprecedented law. Some combi - nation of the Children Act and the existing mechanisms of injunction and embargo could be invoked quite easily. After all, our legal system under the last Government seemed to find no trouble at all in bringing in a ""Mary Bell order"" preventing . young Flora Keays, daughter of . Sara , from being mentioned. Even her mother was not allowed to speak her name to anybody , ""except"", the judge kindly
said, ""perhaps your cleaner."" When it comes to banning publication, the British experience seems to be that where there's a will, there's a way. Mr Blair and the Prince, of Wales are on friendly terms; they could together devise a blanket of total privacy for the Princes, and even extend it with reasonable efficiency to foreign publications. If it were known that any periodical which used a photograph or report on the young Princes' lives during their minority would risk having its owner.staff and other contributors banned permanently from Britain, or arrested if resident here, the game might lose its charm. Of course, the Royal Family would, have to join the self-denying ordinance. It could be decided that, in these exceptional circumstances, neither of the Prince of Wales's sons should perform any public duties, nor be visible patrons of any
""By divine right of kings,"" I ventured, trying with difficulty to enter into the spirit of this dialogue. ""Oh great, by Dl-yine right,"" she giggled. ""That's just what did happen."" The speed with which she ran through her list of subjects would not have disgraced a bank chair - man anxious to catch the Ascot train. One moment she was on the subject of John Major's allegedly feeble response to the ""could Camil - la be queen?"" question: ""Major and my husband are both very alike, quite BFs these days, always seeing each other."" The next moment it was how photographers could help her to present her case to the people. Next it was how stuffiness and protocol prevented her from going to John Smith's funeral: ""It may not have been a full state
occasion but it became a powerful public event and no one from the Royal Family was there/' ""Did you object or try and explain that to anyone?"" I asked. ""No , it would be awful to have been turned down twice,"" she said. Underlying everything was her sense of her personal contact, through the media, with the British people and the family's fear of that. ""My husband's father once sent me a long formal letter setting out the duties of the Princess of Wales. There was 'much more to it than being popular', he said. I sent him back a long letter in reply. He sent me a shorter one—and so on until I finally signed off with 'it 's been so nice getting to know you like this'. One day those letters will all be found in the archives. So will the memos by which my husband and
I communicate too. Can you believe it?"" . - She made it clear that she alone, she felt, could manage her image, her job and her family. She felt that her husband's friends were manip - ulating the press against her — as they had done on this very day — and (hat her only recourse was to fight like with like. And on this day too, she had a plan. To my horror she began to set out a complicated story about how she had helped a tramp who had fallen into the Regent's Park canal and was going to see him in hospital that afternoon. This ""Diana rescues tramp"" story was new to me. But I had missed enough ""royal exclu s - ives "".in my life to be.far from sure that 1 had not just somehow missed
this one too. That prospect obviously worried her as well. I did not seem interest - ed enough . Some bits of her story did not fit together as well as a true story should. Yet it seemed churlish to cross-examine a Princess who, in any case, had such a clear and crowded agenda of her own. It was just at this moment that we were saved by the waitress and her warning that the newspaper paparazzi — with their special guides to pricing dresses, shoes and hats — were gathered outside the main restaurant door for her exit. The Times car was at the side. We both slipped out of the door — and into the back seat. ""University College Hospital,"" I said and we drove back across Park Lane. I began to explain to our passenger that this ruse was all rather pointless since no paparazzi were anywhere to be seen. Then she pointed to the wooded area in the central reservation of the road. First one lens caught the light. Then another behind a low branch, another on a thick trunk and others she said that she saw up in the trees: There was one man that she
recognised, another that she began to wave to before the moment had passed and the car was on its way to the tramp. There was then a sharp banging on the top of the car. I started with alarm. The Princess was much calmer. Sitting six feet above the road, holding no camera that either of us could see, a unicyclist was correcting his balance with a rest upon our roof. Later that day a royal messenger delivered a thick cream letter, thanking me for the ""rescue"" in an airy open hand. 'Today of all days it meant a great deal to me not to be photographed."" The next day the newspapers carried full acounts of how the Princess had saved the tramp^ The Times carried the story too, though without any briefing from me. It seemed perhaps the least interesting part of what the Princess had said. charity, nor pose for any released photographs until they are 18 (with, again, limited exposure until they are 21). This may be a PR loss to the Royal Family but given what has happened this week, the whole strategy of the family as a glitzy ""firm"" ought to be rethought, and the balance of PR and privacy reconsidered.
S ome media people will think me crazy to suggest this; they have been kind enough to say so already. It will be argued that the nation has a ""right"",to see the future heir to the throne. .But that js creepy, disingen - uous nonsense: 'there is an immedi - ate heir readily available for photography and interview at countless public occasions. The nation must make do with him. There will also be portentous voices which will say that it is vital for the young Princes to be ""groomed"" for public appearances and duties during their minority, and that is even more nonsensical. The two members of the Royal Family who have carried out their public duties with most flair and popularity in this century are the Queen Mother — who never did any of it until her marriage — and Diana, Princess of Wales, who was a nursery-school assistant until she was 19. If the argument is that the boys must ""get used"" to constant
exposure and its effects, I think they have already done that. If the argument is the robust line touted about by big, tough tabloid editors, that they must ""get used to han - dling it"" — for God's sake, how cruel can you get? So offer Diana one last tribute, and her family a small atonement. Agree that after the funeral, there is no need for anybody but their friends, schoolmates and families to see or hear about the two Princes again until they are adults, fit to take on. the strange, dangerous world they were born to. Let us simply have annual confirmation in the Christmas broadcast that they are well. It would be a grand gesture, and whatever it takes — law, self-restraint , shame, high - level meetings — it can. only be worth it. It is the decent thing to do. It could also offer the only chance we have that Prince (then King) William will ever, his whole life long, begin to forgive and to trust the fourth estate of his realm.","iVPerrief with the Princess","1997-09-02","A Perrier with the Princess"

"September 02, 1997","['Sue Corrigan']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","Everyone will remember where they were when they heard the news that Diana had died, says Sue Gorrigan The news was so shocking that for a brief moment, time froze. It was precisely the same sensation as hearing the first unbelievable reports, 34 years ago, that John F. Kennedy had been assassinat - ed in Dallas.
The shock was made even worse by the merciless timing. Sunday morning is, for most, a peaceful, sleepy, cosy time. Nothing much happens. Few people are out and about, there is little traffic, the tele - phone doesnt ring for a few hours, and all seems blessedly quiet. This Sunday morning was to be different. All over Brit - ain , telephones shrilled in the early morning as friends and relatives rang from across the world to break the news. It was as though people overseas

needed to speak to someone in Britain before they could believe the news flashes on their own television and radio stations. But taking the calls, often when only half-awake , people in this country had to rush to their own television and radio sets before they themselves could believe what they were hearing. Around Britain, people were woken by the sound of family members crying or shouting out the news from kitchens and sitting rooms. Others were woken by clock radios, broadcasting not Sunday morning 's usual soothing music but first details of the ghastly events in Paris. Just as on the day of John F. Kennedy's death, every person in Britain will remember for the rest of their lives exactly where they were and what they were doing when they first heard the news, that Diana, Princess of Wales, was dead. The following are just a few accounts:
DAVID Leigh , of Horsham, West Sussex, was woken at 6.30am by a phone call from his mother in Australia. Because of time zone differences — Australia is nine hours ahead of the UK — millions of Australians had already heard the news on early afternoon tele - vision and radio bulletins. ""My mother was semi-hyster ical,"" he says. Mr Leigh's wife, Sue, says: ""I live in fear of a call in the middle of the night informingine that someone in my family has j been killed. I went into the ; sitting room to ask about j the call and my husband told; me he had some bad news and that I had better sit down. He told me to turn on the TV because, frankly, I didn't believe him. ""I had to go out a few hours later and I left the house in a complete daze. I was so preoccupied and shocked that I almost caused a crash myself.""
ANNABEL Heseltine: ""I was in Brussels with friends. 1 came downstairs in the morning and they were all I watching TV. I had to go through Paris to get home, so I decided to see the tunnel where she died."" CAROL Midgely, a Times journalist, was visiting her parents in Lancashire. Her father shouted out the news up the stairs, waking her at 8.30am. ""My parents were really shocked. I jumped in the car to return to London but the journey took about seven hours because of bad delays on the Ml. I saw many people in cars alongside me crying."" VIRGINIA Ironside, ago - ny aunt: ""A friend rang me surprisingly early to ask me if I'd heard the news. I thought she must have an appalling piece of gossip to ring this early—like a i mutual friend had runoff with a show girl /What was interesting was that she
felt it was intimate gossip, which shows how much Di - ana meant to everybody. I took a flower to Kensington Palace. When I got there I couldnt believe I was doing it."" BRYCE Corbett, a tourist, says: ""I was checking out of my hotel when the desk clerk asked me if I had heard. I didn't believe it, so he turned on the radio so I could hear for myself. I spent about four hours wandering aimlessly around Oxford listening to a radio through headphones, completely numbed. Then I called my girlfriend in Australia about it and then a friend in London. I needed to talk about what had happened."" RICHARD Branson, the head of the Virgin Group, was flying from Los Angeles to London when the news came
through. He was on board fhe ' -Lady in Red, the plane which the Princess had named three years earlier. ""The fax said that her friend had been killed and that she had been seen staggering from the car. We desperately hoped that she was okay,"" says Mr Branson who had regularly dined with the Princess. Mr Branson fell asleep but was woken by the pilot. He was ashen-faced . ""I will never forget it. He said: 'Princess Diana is dead.' I knew what he was saying must be true but I did not want to believe it."" Shortly be - fore they touched down Mr Branson broke the news to the passengers. Many broke down in tears. ""When we landed at Heathrow it was eerily quiet. Then I knew for sure that she had gone. I will miss her.""
MICHAEL Knipe, of Camden, North London, went to bed relatively ear - ly on Saturday, leaving his wife to watch a late-night movie. ""My wife heard the first news flash that Dodi Fayed had been killed and woke me up. We listened to the radio for a while. As soon as I woke, I turned on the radio again and lis - t ened to the news until about 9am, when I turned on the television coverage, which I found totally hypnotising. ""In the afternoon we walked around Holland Park and as we were quite close to Kensington Palace, I sug - gested we go there. There were about 1,000 people there at 4pm. We stayed for about 30 minutes, then re - turned home, watching

I knew Diana , Princess of Wales, was dead. For me there wasn't a stunning moment when the news broke which meant that the enor - mity of the event took some time to dawn on me. ""The most poignant mo - ment was not when I was on air, but when I watched the plane land at RAF Northolt with the sound of the last hymn at St. Paul's playing in the back - ground . That is a scene I will not forget. ""I was on air from 5am until 9.30, with Peter Allen of Radio 5 Live, We were broadcasting on Radio 2,3,4 and 5, breaking news to the nation as they were wak-. ing up.

Everyone around the village was - very quiet, and all the flags were at half-mast . I don't
think anyone could quite believe it. I can't believe she's not just going to be back in the newspapers tomorrow."" LORD Blake, the constitu - tionalist and historian who advises Buckingham Pal - ace , was in bed listening to the BBC World Service. He had switched on at 4.30am after a bad night's sleep. ""The music was dismal. At 4.55am the programme was interrupted by a voice saying: 'We interrupt the programme to bring the sad news of the death of Di - ana , Princess of Wales, and her companion Dodi Fayed in a motor car accident in Paris.'There was no
doubt. ""It was a dreadful feel - ing . I was absolutely stunned. I lay staring ahead of me. I decided to get up. Sleep would have been impossible."" The historian went downstairs and turned on the television. ""I was glued to it for three hours. I did not move. And then the phone started ringing."" Lord Blake says he was working in his study when he heard about the assassina - tion of President Kennedy: ""But this news about the Princess was much more shocking because of her youth, her beauty, her young sons, and the fact she was doing so much good. I still feel numb today."" CLEMENTINA Ajuonuma, of Newham, East London, was woken by
the sound of her mother's screams of horror and disbe - lief after turning on the television to watch an early news bulletin on Sunday morning. ""She was so shocked and upset, she was almost hysterical,"" Clementina says. ""Just after my mother heard, an aunt rang . She had been called at 6am by a relative in Florida, and then shortly after by another relative in Italy. We left at 8.30am to go to church. Everyone at the service knew. Many were crying."" LORD Archer of Weston - super - Mare was woken with the news by a telephone call at 4.10am from his closest friend Sir Nicholas Lloyd, the former editor of the Daily
Express. ""I woke Mary. Her first words were: Those poor boys'."" Within minutes the tele - phone was ringing with inter - view requests from broadcasters around the world. ""It was one of the darkest moments of my life,"" he said. When John F. Kennedy died Lord Archer was in the Oxford Union.

"September 02, 1997","['Stephen Farrell']","['News']","THE seven photographers arrested after the crash were expected to be held overnight to appear before an investigat - ing judge this morning, when some may face charges of failing to give assistance and of flight from the scene. More serious charges seemed less likely after the disclosure that the driver of the Fayed car had'been drunk. Lawyers for some of the photographers said they were, confident they would be re - leased without charge. William Bourdon, lawyer for Nicolas Arsov, of Sipa, said unofficial prosecution sources confirmed that all or some were likely to be charged with failing to assist the victims of an accident or leaving the scene . 'The .fact ; that: the- driver consurned.aicohoi ties in with the crazy speed at which he was driving. It just shows that no photographer \vas directly or indirectly involved with causing this accident. People
should have been more careful before accusing them,"" he said. . Lawyers and colleagues of the seven paparazzi yesterday gave accounts vastly different from the Fayed version of events. A source close to the legal team of Jacques Langevin , an awaid-winning photographer with the Sygma agency, claimed he arrived at the scene by accident. He pointed out that M Langevin was more used to covering news assignments in Africa and claimed he only happened to be on call that night when told to go to the. Ritz. He said: ""The most impor - tant point to make is that he arrived after it happened, and he was in a car, not on a motorbike. He did not follow them. He could not because he had to .walk 4p_ his, car after mey left arid that; took time: When yduare On foot and you have Damon Hill in a Ferrari, you just say'goodbye'. "" . He ; claimed that M
Stephen Farrell looks at lawyers' claims that paparazzi are innocent
Langevin had simply driven in the same direction and had arrived at the crash site after police but was still arrested by police, who seized all his photographic equipment and films. He saw his lawyer for less than half an hour on Sunday evening and was re - portedly ""shocked"" by the deaths. ""He was just passing, per - haps 'on his way home. It is a main road. Everyone, uses it.

of paparazzi. He is well known as a reasonable guy."" He said he had been unable to see his client M Bourdon said the prosecutor could re - lease the photographers with - out charge, or charge them and bring them before an investigating judge. The judge could then release a suspect
pending the outcome of an investigation, or keep him in custody. . One of the photographers being held by the French police has had a breakdown in custody, according to the Brit - ish cameraman Jason Fraser, the man who sold the first pictures of the Princess and
Dodi Fayed on holiday. ""I have already heard that a couple of the photographers have taken it very badly, as I'm sure they should. One of them has had a breakdown over it. I think it is a lesson that everyone has now learnt."" He was speaking on LBC radio in London.

From MrRupen Mullick Sir, The Royal Family and the Estab - lishment must take note from the depth and breadth of the late Prin - cess 's immense popularity that, in or - der to command respect and love from ordinary people, they must touch the hearts of their subjects in the same way as she did. The so-called stiff upper lip is a thing of the Victorian era which has little value in a modern society. It is good to show your feelings at times of such immense loss and grief. I watched with utter disbelief as members of the Royal Family (includ - ing Princes William and Harry) went to church on Sunday morning as nor - mal whilst the Princess's body lay in a Paris hospital. Like any other be - reaved father, Mohamed Al Fayed flew straight to Paris immediately he was informed of his son's tragic death. I suppose that was the difference in attitude which the Princess was trying to bridge and hence her separation from the Royal Family.

THE King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery will cany the coffin of Diana, Princess of Wales, to Westminster Abbey on a gun carriage of the type first used for the state funeral of King Edward VII in 1910. Traditionally , a 13-pounder gun carriage has been used for state and military funer - als . Queen Victoria was the first monarch to be given a parade-type funeral, using a gun carriage. The present style of gun carriage was designed for the Royal Horse Artillery in 1904, three years after Queen Victoria's death. It saw action in the First World War. The funeral duties will be performed by ""F"" subsection of the King's Troop, com - manded by Captain Grant Chanter (RHA), Sergeant Damian Gascoigne, the ser - geant commanding the gun detachment on Saturday, will lead the procession on his horse, officially called 39 - Henchman , next to the lead driver, Lance Bombardier Graham Innes. Behind them will be the
centre driver, Gunner Barry Logan, and behind him the wheel driver, Lance Bombar - dier Damon Humphreys Each driver will have a ""hand horse"", a riderless member of the gun team. These four men will be the only mounted members of the King's Troop. All of their horses will be black. Taking up the rear, on foot, behind the gun carriage and the limber, a box on wheels which carries ammunition in war but spare harnesses and other equipment on ceremoni - al duty, will be, the ""brake ; man"". He will be responsible
for controlling the manual brake. Next to him will be Captain Chanter, the Left Section Commander. Alongside will be the trace bearers, men from the King's Troop, who will carefully watch the movement of the leather-coated steel wires that connect the horses to the gun carriage. They will have to ensure that the traces keep off the ground in any tight turns, although no sharp corners are envisaged on the route to the Abbey. These four men will be on foot. Major Keith Brooks (RHA), the Commanding Officer of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, which was formed in 1947, has selected trace bearers with special trade skills to ensure that, in the event of any accident or damage to the gun carriage, they are able to repair it. The trace bearers will include a master saddler and a master farrier. All the members of ""F ""
subsection of the King's Troop will be wearing the full dress of the Royal Horse Artillery. They will be in - volved in rehearsals for the Princess's funeral throughout this week. The coffin bearing the body of the Princess will sit on an oak board suspended a few inches above the 131b gun barrel. It will lie along the length of the barrel. The weight of the gun and limber combined is about lh tonnes but with the coffin, the oak board and brackets, the total weight will be about two tonnes. The gun carriage is kept at St John'Wood Barracks. The bearer party for the funeral, which will be respon - sible for removing the coffin from the gun carriage and taking it into the abbey, will
be supplied from the Bngade of Guards. Gun carriages of the Royal Horse Artillery have been used on six previous occa - sions this century: for King Edward VII in 1910, King George V in 1936, King George VI in 1952, Sir Win - ston Churchill in 1965, the Duke of Windsor in 1972, and Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1979. The gun was designed for battle and when it was taken to war it represented a signifi - c an t technological advance , capable of more rapid fire than previous models. It won battle honours in the First World War at Nery in France, when L {Nery) Battery of the Royal Horse Artillery was involved in the retreat from Mons. The men's bravery was rewarded with a number of Victoria Crosses .

"September 03, 1997","['Charles Bremner and Stephen Farrell']","['News']","SIX photographers and a mo - torcycle courier who allegedly chased Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed to their deaths in Paris are to face manslaughter charges, The seven, who were de - tained at the scene of the crash early on Sunday, will also be charged with failing.to help the victims. Police reports yesterday described the pho - tographers ' behaviour as ""vir - ulent "" as they clamoured to take pictures of the wrecked car and its occupants. The manslaughter charges were brought by the investi - gating judge Herve Stephan in spite of reports that the Princess's driver was drunk and against the advice of the state prosecutor who said there was no evidence that the photographers had forced her Mercedes off the road. Lawyers for the photogra - phers immediately com - plained that their clients were being made scapegoats be - cause of the victims' celebrity and the need for a show trial.
At least two of the men claimed to have arrived at the scene after the police, includ - ing the Sygma agency's award-winning war photogra - pher Jacques Langevin, whose lawyer said he had ""happened upon the accident"" while driv - ing home. The lawyer for the Gamma agency's Romuald Rat said that he had been taking the Princess's pulse when the police arrived. Apart from M Langevin, 45, and M Rat, 30, those charged were Christian Martinez, 35, who works for Daniel Angeli — the man who took the pictures of John Bryan suck - ing the Duchess of York's toes; Nicholas Arsov, 30, of Sipa; the freelances Serge Arnal, 35, and Laszlo Verez, 48; and the Gamma driver Stephen Darmon, 30. They were all told that they were being ""placed under examination"" on charges of involuntary homicide — the lesser of two manslaughter offences — and with non-assistance to endan - gered persons. Under the French legal sys -

tern, the charging of the men is a less definitive step than it would be in England. The examining judge will not de - cide until after an investiga - tion lasting several months whether the case should actu - ally go to court. If it did, the men would be be tried without a jury and if convicted they would face a maximum of five years in jail./ All seven Were released last night pending the further in - vestigations , after M Stephan overruled prosecutors who said that the actions of M Martinez and M Rat had been ""so detestable"" that they should be held in custody. They were freed on bail of 100,000 francs (£10,000) and
banned from leaving France and from working for the duration of the case. Police reports leaked yester - day said that the paparazzi's behaviour had been virulent and repellent and that they had wilfully obstructed at - tempts to help the victims — a view reinforced by evidence from closed-circuit television cameras, confiscated photo - graphs and eye-witness accounts. According to the reports,a fireman asked a policeman to keep the Princess conscious by talking to her and patting her face, but the cameramen put up such strong resistance to attempts to move them that an officer had to call in reinforce - ments . He said: ""I couldnt hold back the photographers and help the injured at the same time."" Another said: ""They were aggresive and pushy, continuing to take pho - tographs , preventing me from helping the victim."" And when forced to move
one photographer was quoted as saying: ""You make me sick. Let me do my job. In Sarajevo, the cops let us work."" So far, the only hard evi - dence gathered by police con -
cerns events after the accident and investigators have still not confirmed claims by lawyers acting for Mohamed Al Fayed that the photographers had provoked the accident that killed his son. - Bernard Dartevelle, acting for Mr Al Fayed, had never - theless pressed for the men to face the more serious man - slaughter offence of "" deliver - ing fatal blows"", and yesterday the Harrods owner filed a civil suit that will allow him to take part in any trial and to claim reparation if the photographers are convicted. The lawyer Georges Kiej - man said that he had in - formed the investigating magistrate and asked for the inquiry to be widened to include counts of a possible violation of privacy. ""This is very important in so far as this is a prior chapter to the tragedy and there is a causal link,"" he said. ""There was a
chase without which the driv - er would neither have taken that route nor used that speed."" The parents of Henri Paul, the Mercedes driver, also filed a civil suit. Legal experts said that it had been almost inevitable that the photographers would face some charges, given the wealth of accounts of paparaz - zi swarming around the Mercedes as the police arri - ved . But William Bourdon, acting for M Arsov, said: ""If the victims had not been of such exceptional quality this litigation would never have been brought with such theat - ricality . I hope that the situa - tion will become more calm."" M Bourdon said that his client had initially followed a decoy Range Rover driven by Mr Fayed's regular chauffeur in a different direction from the Mercedes. He had then doubled back and arrived at the scene after the police and ambulance.

"September 03, 1997","","['News']","THE pop star Madonna has said that the Princess of Wales once asked her for advice about how to handle press attention. In an interview with The Times she also says that she shares with the public some blame for the Princess's death . Madonna describes a conversation she had with the Princess at a charity cocktail party in London two years ago: ""I said I had always sympathised with her pos - ition , and made some joke about how the only person who seemed to get more attention than me was her. She said, 'I think you handle the press better than I do,' and I replied, 'You will have to get skin as thick as an armadillo.' ""She said, 'We must get together and you can tell me how,' and we agreed to meet when I was over in England again. I
had wanted Diana to host a royal premiere of Evita but for some reason we couldnt put it together. And we never did meet."" Madonna says that she broke down when she heard that the Princess had been hurt in a car accident. ""I was crying, 'Please God, let her live.' I, have been chased down that tunnel so many times I have lost count. - ""If there weren't such large offers of money, then these people wouldn't go to such extremes to take the pictures. Then you have to look at the editors and ask who is responsible for this. But even that does not dig deep enough. As much as I want to blame the press, we all have bSood on bur hands. All of us, even myself. I bought those magazines and I read them."" She describes the lengths some photog - raphers have gone to for a picture of her. On one occasion, she says, they paid chil -
dren to lie under her car so it would look like they were trapped beneath the wheels. She acknowledges the parallels be - tween herself and the Princess: ""People had the same fixation with her that they do with me. You were never allowed to make mistakes without being hanged in the public square. Then there was this idea that neither of us could have a relationship with a man; that we would never find one we could connect to because our marriages had failed; that we were unlovable."" Madonna says that without her friends she would have been unable to cope with the pressures of fame. ""I sensed a kind of desperation from the Princess and I realised she did not have the same kind of support from friends as I have."" Interview, page 17

The only possible charge in this country would appear to be causing death by dangerous driving under section one of the Road Traffic Act, which carries up to ten years' imprisonment. But the prosecution would again have to show , a causal link: that the photogra^ phers caused the deaths of thoseiri the car and that their standard of driving fell far below that which would be expected of a competent and careful driver. There is no ""Good Samaritan"" law in Britain, requiring people to go the assistance of road traffic victims. But there is a summary offence of failing to
stop and report an accident under the Road Traffic Act, which carries a fine of a maximum of £5,000 or six months' imprisonment. . If it could be shown that none of the photographers called the emergency ser - vices on arrival at the scene of the crash, then they could be charged with this offence. . . . Yesterday Roger Ede, secretary of the Law Society's criminal law committee,, said that the provisions of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, parts of which have already come into operation, could be used to prosecute paparazzi p hotogra - phers who cause harassment or fear of violence. .

"September 04, 1997","['Ian Brodie and Martin Fletcher']","['News']","GERRY ADAMS resumed his role as a political celebrity in the United States yesterday and immediately took issue with Tony Blair. He also offered Sinn Fein's con - dolences for the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The Sinn Fein leader, ad - dressing a packed press con - ference at the National Press Club in Washington, rejected the Prime Minister's assertion that Ireland would not be united in his lifetime. Asked why Mr Blair had said ""no"" to a united govern - ment , Mr Adams said he thought there was a battle going on in the British Estab - lishment between ""those who have run the place for a long time and those now in con - trol "". He said that Mr Blair had certainly taken the right course in agreeing to talks, but the British Government was a player and not the referee. Mr Adams was speaking under the silent gaze of Martin McGuinness, who will be Sinn Fein's chief negotiator at the Northern Ireland talks. Mr Adams promised that Sinn Fein would abide by whatever was agreed at the
talks, but could not be expect - ed to lower its expectations in advance of negotiations. When pressed if he would use the word compromise, he said Sinn Fein wanted peace. ""Compromise is two people coming to an agreement. We do it all the _ time in our relationships. Compromise is a two-way street."" He bridled at a question from an American reporter that the IRA had tried to kill the Princess of Wales in 1983. ""I treat with complete derision fantasy stories that the IRA were going to try and kill the British Princess Diana."" The question was based on a claim by Sean O'Callaghan , an IRA assassin turned in - former , that he had saved the lives of the Prince and Princess of Wales by scuttling an IRA plan to blow up the royal box at a pop concert in London in 1983. Mr Adams said there had been no evidence or suggestion ""of any real kind"" to back up the defector 's assertion. He also expressed his condolences over the death of the Princess, which he called a ""tragic accident"" . Later Mr Adams went to the
White House for his first meeting with President Clin - ton 's new National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, Jim Steinberg, the deputy adviser, and Larry Butler, who has arrived from the US Embassy in Dublin to direct Irish affairs for the National Sec - urity Council. President Clinton has met Mr Adams on previous visits but remains on holiday and will not see him this time. Al Gore, the Vice-President , was in the building but did not meet Mr Adams , who said he would like to have ""bumped into him"". Mr Gore 's attitude is a measure of the wariness that persists since the IRA bombed Canary Wharf. Officials emphasised to Mr Adams the importance of maintaining the ceasefire and of Sinn Fein's constructive participation in the formal peace talks, set for
Monday, and in talks about decommissioning. Both sides said the talks were construc - tive and positive. Today, Mr Adams and his colleagues will attend a recep - tion at the House of Represen - tatives then fly to New York for a fundraising event at the Waldorf Astoria. In Northern Ireland, there is growing concern that US dollars could help Sinn Fein to overtake the Social Demo - cratic and Labour Party as the Province's biggest nationalist party . Since March 1995, Sinn Fein has collected $1.5 million (£931,000) from Americans who claim Irish descent. The chairman of the peace negotiations said yesterday that the Province was on the brink of an historic opportuni - ty to resolve the troubles. But Senator George Mitchell said that if the chance was to be taken, politicians from both communities would have to overcome mutual mistrust.

Such bizarre theories are being propagated by official and semi-official media throughout the Middle East. The extent to which ordinary Arabs believe them became apparent yester - day when a poll conducted in the West Bank showed that 47 per cent of readers of Palestinian papers were certain that the Paris car accident had been engineered. No proof has been offered for what British officials dismissed as ""absurd"" suggestions, and only anonymous sources — or no sources at all — have been quoted. But this has failed to quash the claims that the crash was arranged because the Princess's affair with Dodi Fayed, an Arab and a Muslim, went against the prejudices of the British Establishment. Writing in the state-owned Egyptian daily A! Ahram, one of the leading papers in the Arab world, the colum - nist Anis Mansour, a former confidant of President Sadat, alleged: ""She was

killed by British Intelligence to save the monarchy . . . Nobody since Crom - well , who called for a republic in the 17th century, has been able to shake the Royal Family as Princess Diana did."" Despite the lack of evidence to support the theories, many Arabs seem to take them seriously. ""I and many of my friends are convinced that the brakes of the car were tampered with by British agents paid by your Queen. She did not want the possibility of half - Arab children getting close to the Crown,"" said Yasser, an Arab working at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem who would not reveal his surname. The conspiracy theories, which have won support from some Israelis con - vinced by the experience of their own region that such accidents do not just happen, have been shamelessly fuelled by Colonel Gaddafi's anti-Western regime in Tripoli . Libya's official news agency Jana said in one dispatch picked up by radio
stations throughout the Arab world that Libya's human rights commission had issued a statement saying : ""Only children believe that it was an acci - dent ."" It accused Britain of setting up the accident and France of carrying it out. In London, the Foreign Office said that a letter of protest was being sent to Libya. ""Obviously we are aware of these absurd allegations made by Gaddafi and find them extremely distasteful,"" a spokesman said. The accusations fell on fertile ground because of the belief of many Arabs that they are looked down on by Westerners. This conviction had been reinforced by what were seen as deliberate steps by the British Estab - lishment to prevent Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed Al Fayed, from securing British citizenship. Far from being restricted' to the lunatic fringe, the theories also circu - lated in countries friendly to Britain.
As Kuwait's daily Al-Siyassah put it, in deliberately vague terms, the Princess and Dod; ' Fayed's close relationship ""embarrassed ' ."". . the dignity of the British lion"". Sultan Hattab, a colum - nist , wrote in the Jordan daily Al-Rai : ""There is a viewpoint that suggests the death of the Princess was engineered."" In Jordan , Leila Khaled, the Pales - tinian revolutionary who led the hi - jacking of an American TWA flight to Damascus in 1969, published a poem of tribute, which she said was ad - dressed to the Princess's sons. Ms Khaled, still a member of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that she planned to send the poem to Tony Blair. ""Sadness and anger engulfed the world, swamping us, when we heard the news of the death of the princess of princesses,"" Ms Khaled wrote ambigu - ously . ""Sadness ... at losing the woman who captivated the world because she broke all tradition to help victims of war, the sick and especially women and children.

Informed sources have con - firmed that the Spencer fam - ily , who have played the major part in organising the service with the Very Rev Wesley Carr, Dean of Westminster, did not veto a contribution to the service from the Prince or any other member of the Royal Family. The Spencer family did feel, however, that Tony Blair was an appropriate figure to give the familiar reading on faith, hope and love from 1 Corinthians. The service will be led by Dr Carr with the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Dr George Carey, leading the prayers, including those for the Prin - cess , for her life and work, and for the Royal Family. Dr Carr said that it would have a threefold purpose: to allow a quifet, reflective time for people to mourn, to give thanks for the Princess's gifts, and to offer a chance to take up acommitment to the causes that she espoused. ""It is essentially the private funeral of an individual, but a very public one. It is a unique tribute to a unique person,"" he said. Traditional in many re - spects , the service will none - theless make numerous concessions to the Princess's character, and the way in which she mirrored the feel - ings of a younger generation. John, an active supporter of many of the Princess's favour - ite causes, was invited by the abbey with the agreement of
the Spencer family and imm - ediately accepted, Dr Carr said yesterday. The new words to the song, beginning ""Goodbye En - gland 's Rose"", written by John's lyricist, Bernie Taupin, are a direct tribute to the Princess. John will accompany himself on his own customised Yamaha grand piano, which will be installed in Westmin - ster Abbey today. The rest of the service bears the clear stamp of Spencer family choice, and includes several pieces dear to the Princess's heart. The first hymn, / Vow, To Thee My Country, to Hoist's familiar melody from The Planets, was her favourite. She was also particularly fond of the Verdi Requiem, and the soprano Lynne Dawson, with the BBC Singers, will sing a passage from its powerful ending. Inclusion of the modern hymn Make Me A Channel
Of Your Peace was a reflection of the Princess's character, Drj Carr said. The traditional sidej of the service will be reflected! in the singing of The King Of Love My Shepherd Is, while the Princess's Welsh connec - tion will be remembered in the final hymn, one of the most stirring of all, sung to. the traditional roof-raising strains of Cwm Rhondda. Among the most poignant sounds of the 50-minute ser - vice will be the choir singing a modern work, composed in 1993 and full of serene Alleluias, Song For Athene. Written by John Tavener as a> tribute to a young friend killed in a cycling accident, its
dying strains will lead the abbey and the watching na - tion into the minute's silence as the cortege processes out by the Great West Door. The silence will be ended by the slow tolling of the abbey's half-muffled bells. As hundreds continued to queue to sign books of. condo - lence last night, it was an - nounced that they would close at midnight tonight , and that mourners at St James's Palace should not join the queue after 6pm. The books of condolence at Kensington Palace will close for the funeral. They will reopen at 2pm tomorrow, and will remain open at least until September 15.

"September 06, 1997","['Charles Bremner']","['News']","FRANCE'S chattering class - es view the wave of emotion in Britain over the Princess's death, in Paris, with curiosity and some distaste. 'The cult of Saint Diana is being born,"" he Monde com - mented from London. ""It is the cult of the perfect woman, somewhere between Marilyn Monroe and Saint Theresa of Lisieux."" This caustic line reflects a remarkable consen - sus across the mainstream media and middle classes over the meaning of what has happened. There is no doubt that much of France has been
touched ' by the Princess's death and feels great sympa - thy for her sons. Many are appalled that she met her end at the hands of an allegedly drunk French driver, pur - sued by a band of French photographers. Lionel Jospin, the Prime Minister, who flew back to the Paris hospital after the accident, said he^was certain that the public backed the decision to investigate the paparazzi under manslaugh - ter charges. Some newspa - pers and defence lawyers say that pressure from Britain forced the decision. The popular weekly glossy magazines that cater to French royalty-lovers have
brought out special issues. A big television audience is expected for the funeral. However, the French reac - tion has run along the coun - try ' s social, divide, with the more educated classes voic - ing an amused aversion for the outpouring of emotion around the world, while the lower orders express their grief. ""Jokes"" were being told at some Paris dinner parties this week as some newspaper cartoonists mocked the Princess's ""beatification "". A fascination for British royalty is held mainly to be the preserve of less educated
women, who tend to buy! celebrity magazines. The rest of the media take a disdainful view of celebrity news, sup-: porting the country's strict; laws on privacy and deplor - ing what they see as the invasion of frivolous Ang lo - Saxon values and methods. Against this background, the chattering classes and media have turned the story into a cautionary tale of the ex - cesses of the age. Le Point, the news weekly, lamented the ""collective hysteria, public commotion and theatrical - isation of pity"". The conservative Figaro took a very similar line, saying that the Princess had joined the list of popular
martyrs that included Prin - cess Grace, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe: ""She incar - nated a beautiful picture for the magazines with all the contradictions of the century: nostalgia for old monarchies, pangs of sympathy for the poor and the myseries of the Third World, the taste for pleasure, the excitment of celebrity, all the shining and dangerous glitter which cov - er a very big emptiness."" The intellectuals have gone into overdrive. One novelist Philippe Sollers, wrote in the Left Bank weekly Le Nouvel Observateur that the Prin - cess had played along with the plot of a low-grade novel ""with a lousy text"" .

"September 06, 1997","['Adam Sage and Richard Ford']","['News']","Pathologist says reports that driver was drunk are unreliable, write Adam Sage and Richard Ford
THE mother and sister of Diana, Princess of Wales, yesterday took the first legal step towards suing the person found responsible for her death. The Princess's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, and one of her two sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, became civil parties to the French criminal investi - gation , according to a French legal source. It was n6t clear last night which of the sisters had taken the action. Under French law, the move gives the Princess's mother and sister access to the investigating magistrate 's dos - sier on the fatal crash. It will also enable them to claim
damages from , whoever is found to have caused the accident. A French legal source said last night: ""When you consti - tute yourself as a civil party, the logical second step is to claim damages."" The funeral of the driver, Henri Paul, was cancelled yesterday after his family re - portedly called for a second autopsy and. questioned claims that he had been drunk at the time of the accident. M Paul was due to have been buried this morning in his home town of Lorient in Brittany. A pathologist re - tained by Mohamed Al Fayed claimed last night that French
reports that he was drunk were unreliable. Professor Peter Vanezis, was has been hired by Mr Al Fayed to review the French pathologist's reports on his son, Dodi, said that M Paul was not necessarily drunk and that the alcohol level found in his blood could be a result of contamination caused by his serious injuries. Professor Vanezis, Regius Professor and Head of Forensic Medicine, at Glasgow University, said that, because M Paul had suffered such extensive internal inju - ries , the possibility of contami - nated blood was real and must be considered. ""Therefore any such alcohol
finding as has been reported cant be treated as reliable,"" he told a press conference in Harrods yesterday. ""There are many reasons why the level of alcohol may be too high for the amount consumed or where none has been consumed. There are many questions that need to be asked. It is unsafe and unfair to reach any final conclusion."" In Paris a legal source said that M Paul's family were also unhappy with the original post-mortem examination, which found that he had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit. The pathologist 's reports have suggested that MPaul ,
deputy head of security at the Paris Ritz, had drunk more than three times France's alco - hol limit for driving. One report found 175 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and a second registered a higher finding of 187 milli - grams per 100 millilitres. Professor Vanezis spent 12' hours studying the patholo - g ist 's reports but did not see the body of M Paul and did not carry out an autopsy. The professor said that, although several samples had been taken, only one had been analysed. This blood sample had been divided and sent to separate laboratories. Sam -
ples had also been taken from the eye, urine and gall blad - der , but he said that reports he had reviewed did not disclose whether any of them had been tested. ""I don't know whether they were tested. It was not in the report presented to the prose - cuting authorities,"" he said, adding that, if no other sam - p les had been analysed, it would prevent French pathol - og ists making comparisons with others taken from the body. .. The professor said that the analysis revealing a high blood alcohol level had been released ""a little prematurely ""
and that he did not know y/hether the French authori - ties had or would carry out further tests. He said that the blood alcohol level could be affected in a number of ways, particu - larly after accidents. This in - cluded contamination by bacteria, improper removal of the sample or chemical reac - tions from a ruptured body, producing an alcohol level on victims who had not drunk anything. The Princess's mother and sister would be able to ask the judge who tries the case to order the guilty party to pay compensation, he said. They would be able to claim damages for distress and any material loss incurred as a result of death. The source said: ""If she gave them money
on a regular basis, they could certainly ask to be compensat - ed . The level of damages would depend on the amount ithey received from her."" I In France, damages for ! distress do not usually run to imore than a few thousand ^ pounds. However, the source said money may not be the motive. As civil parties, they will be able to follow the investigation. They will also be told about any new devel - opments or witnesses to the accident who come forward during the inquiry. The Princess's mother and sister are to be represented by a Parisian lawyer, Alain ' Toucas, who declined to com - ment . Mr Al Fayed has al - ready joined the case as a civil party, as has the family of M Paul.

"September 08, 1997","['Alan Hamilton']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","B^^^K SSB^^^^^SlHl ^^R IT IS usually impossible, under the carapace of pomp bestowed by the interior of Westminster Abbey and with the entire Royal Family assembled under the lantern, to avoid the sense of a state occasion. Yet Saturday's service, for all the majesty of setting and the beauty of familiar music and liturgy, projected a sharp edge that set it apart from the clockwork predictability of a state funeral. It was an occa - sion for the Spencer family to reclaim the soul of their sister Diana, Princess of Wales, and to enter their bid for the souls of her sons. On the other side of the house, it was an occasion that sorely tried the composure of the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince Harry. There were moments when -the power of music, whether
by Elton John or Verdi, tipped them over the edge. But funerals are celebra - tions of a life as much as grievings over a death. Bril - liant shafts of sun piercing the clerestory windows, augment - ed by banks of television lighting, did much to dilute any sense of the sombre that could so easily have enveloped the proceedings. So, too, did the music, from the familiarly rousing to the hauntingly, piercingly ethereal, which lift - ed the spirits from the floor to a point on the route to heaven. For a preliminary hour and a half, the congregation trick - led in, a kaleidoscopic body of 1,900 men and women repre - senting the endless facets of the Princess's short life. There were the great and the good, although their numbers were severely curtailed to make room for more intimate
associates. Prime Ministers past and present attended, as did a smattering of other politi - cians , including Robin Cook, John Prescott, William Hague and Paddy Ashdown, Douglas Hurd and Betty Boothroyd. There were no foreign heads of state, but four sent their wives: Queen Noor of Jordan, Suzanne -Mubarak of Egypt, Hillary Clinton and Berna - dette Chirac. ' There were two men who had touched the highs and lows of her life significantly: Lord Runcie, who officiated at
Dancing sunlight , a pop anthem , an angry eulogy, waves of applause: the service was emotional, powerful and unpredictable, says Alan Hamilton
her wedding, and Mohamed Al Fayed, whose son died with her. The arts were represented in force: Lords Gowrie and Attenborough, Sir David Puttnam, Chris de Burgh, Sir Cliff Richard and a clearly emotional Luciano Pavarotti. There were the Emanuels , who had made her wedding dress; Henry Kissinger; Rich - ard Branson, who wants to raise millions in her memory; the journalists Richard Kay and Martin Bashir, who gave her a platform in print and television, and even two loyal fans, young gay men, who made a profession of turning up at her every appearance and waving at her in adula - tion from the front of the crowd. There were her staff, past and present, from her former equerry Edward.Musto from royal days to her public rela - tions adviser Jane Atkinson, whose employment was brief. But many of the congrega - tion were unknown faces, workers for her wide range of charities and interests. Several walked with artificial legs; they had lost their limbs to
landmines, whose eradication was one of the Princess's favourite causes. Then came her family: her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, her sisters, Jane and Sarah, with their husbands and child - ren , who arrived together and moved up the aisle as a tight knot of ten, all in black. Her former stepmother, Raine Spencer, Countess of Cham - brun , arrived separately and sat apart. The Royal Family arrived in ascending order of prece - dence , beginning with the Ogilvys. The Duke and Duch - ess of York, although di - vorced , arrived together, holding their young daugh - ters ' hands. Finally came the Queen, serene and composed, accompanied by Prince Ed - ward and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, defying her 97 years by walking with only slight difficulty and the aid of stick. All were seated. The sound of the organ, which had been playing a selection chosen largely by the Spencers, died away. At the brilliant sunlight of the Great West Door there appeared a vibrant splash of
colour: the red tunics of the Welsh Guards bearing the coffin draped in the Royal Standard, surmounted by family wreaths of white lilies that quivered in time to the slow step of the pallbearers. Flowers from Prince Harry were accompanied by a card inscribed simply ""Mummy "". Behind the coffin, black silhouettes against the sun, stood . the chief mourners who had walked with the cortege: the Prince of Wales, Prince William, Prince Harry, Earl Spencer and, a pace behind them at the door, the Duke of Edinburgh.
They stopped for the nat - ional anthem, resuming their slow progress up the aisle to the perfect notes of the choris - ters singing the Sentences. Behind them the chief mourn - e rs walked with heads bowed, until the coffin was placed on its catafalque before the high altar. The Queen and the Duke were handed a white wreath by the clergy; together they placed it at the base of the catafalque. Another was given to the Prince of Wales; he placed it alongside, the two boys standing beside him. All three stood in momentary silence before resuming their
seats. In his Bidding the Very Rev Dr Wesley Carr, Dean of Westminster, said: ""In her life, Diana profoundly influenced this nation and the world. Although a Princess, she was someone for whom, from afar, we dared to feel affection, and by whom we were all in - trigued . She kept company with kings and queens, with princes and presidents, but we especially remember her hu - mane concerns and how she met individuals and made them feel significant. In her death she commands the sym - pathy of millions."" The congregation gave voice to / Vow To Thee, My Country, to Hoist's familiar melody from The Planets, a favourite of the Princess. Shortly after - wards , the soprano Lynne Dawson and the BBC Singers delivered the powerful Libera Me from the Verdi Requiem. Here, the Prince of Wales appeared on the point of breaking down, dabbing his
A tribute to the Princess outside Kensington Palace
... a sister reclaimed
eyes with a large white hand - kerchief . Prince William sat with head deeply bowed, his fringe hiding much of his expression, in the manner of his mother in her early days of fame. Prince Harry kept his composure, but when Elton John sat at the piano and sang his tribute version of Candle in the Wind, the younger Prince covered his face and wept. The song will forever be sung as hymn to her memory. Tony Blair read flawlessly the lesson on faith, hope and love from I Corinthians xiii, but with emotion close to the surface of his voice. This is probably read as a lesson more often than any other passage of Scripture, but on this occasion it seemed unusu - ally fitting. When Earl Spencer climbed to the pulpit to deliver his tribute he seemed composed, anH read in a measured voice.
But it soon became clear that this was no ordinary obsequy; he had sharp, pertinent things to say, and was determined to say them in front of millions, however uncomfortable they might be for some. There would never again be such a platform on which to express his family's innermost feelings. There were blunt disclo - sures about his sister. ""Diana explained to me once that it was her innermost feelings of suffering that made it possible for her to connect with her constituency of the rejected ... for all the status, the glamour, the applause , Diana remained
throughout a very insecure .person at heart."" He vented his ire at the media which had sneered at her good intentions, and re - ferred to the manner of her death, chased by paparazzi. ""Of ali the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this: a girl given the name of the ancient goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age,"" But his sharpest words, couched in only a thin veneer of obliqueness , were reserved for the family into which Diana had married, with, ultimately, tragic results: ""She would want us today to pledge
ourselves to protecting her beloved boys, William and Harry, from a similar fate and I do this here, Diana, on your behalf. ""We will not allow them to suffer the anguish that used regularly to drive you to tearful despair."" The congregation sat in utter silence, hanging on every word. There was more. ""And beyond that, on behalf of your mother and sisters, I pledge that we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue the imaginative way in which you were steering these two exceptional young men so that their souls"" are not simply immersed by duty and tradi - tion , but can sing openly as you planned. ""We fully respect the heri - tage into which they have both been born and will always respect and enourage them in their, royal role but we, like you, recognise the need for them to experience as many different aspects of life as possible to arm them spiritual - ly and emotionally for the years ahead. I know you would have expected nothing less from us. ""William and Harry, we all care desperately for you today. We are all chewed up with the sadness at the loss of a woman who was not even our mother. How great your suffering is we cannot even imagine."" The earl's voice, which had
started so strongly, was close to breaking by the end. His last few sentences were deliv - ered on the edge of dissolving. The Queen looked impassive at the thinly veiled criticism of her family's style. William and Harry kept their heads bowed. The Prince of Wales looked wretchedly miserable. And then, lit by a fuse among those listening on speakers in the street outside, a wave of applause began to roll from the back of the abbey all the way to the altar. It was spontaneous and prolonged. William and Harry joined in, clapping politely. The Prince of. Wales tapped his knee. The service returned to more conventional liturgy, with Dr George Carey, Arch - bishop of Canterbury, leading a succession of prayers for the Princess, her family, the Royal Family , for all who mourned, and for the Princess's life and work. Broken only by the choir singing the Londonderry Air, the prayers ended with Dr Carey inviting the entire watching world to join in, in whatever language, the recita - tion of the Lord's Prayer. All was brought back to earth as the organ swelled' with the opening bars of that grand Welsh tune Cwm Rhondda, and the congrega - tion gave full voice to the root raising words of Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer . . The pallbearers returned,
| | l gently lifting the coffin from its catafalque to begin its final journey to Althorp. It pro - cessed down the aisle to the choir singing the ethereal alleluias of John Tavener's modern song, based partly on the closing lines of Hamlet, written in memory of a young friend killed in an accident. As the last high notes trailed off into the roof like smoke, the coffin stopped inside the Great West Door, and an absolute hush descended on the abbey and on the world outside. There was no coughing, no rustling of hymn sheets, no shuffling of feet, only an incalculable number of pri - vate thoughts. The minute's silence was ended by the half-muffled peal of the abbey bells, the coffin moved out to its hearse again followed by the Princes and the earl, and the organ filled the old Gothic cavern with Bach's Prelude in C. The Princess had gone, and the congregation turned to one another to express satisfaction at a service which had not only fulfilled their expectations, but had included an address that will be long remembered. The mourning over, the organ exploded into one of the most joyfully noisy pieces in the entire classical repertoirei They do not play harps at the gates of heaven; they play Camille Saint-Saens' organ symphony — very loudly.

"September 08, 1997","['Carol Midgley, Media Correspondent']","['News']","PRINCE WILLIAM and Prince Harry may be offered increased protection from newspapers under a new code being considered by the Press Complaints Commission. It is believed that the newspaper watchdog may draft a new section that in effect would extend the privacy rights of children of famous people into adulthood. Lord Wakeham, chairman of the commission, will meet editors of tabloid newspapers this week in the light of Earl Spencer's attack on the Press. In a tour of newspaper offices expected to begin today, he will discuss reform and tighter controls on privacy. The earl said that the Princess of Wales had become
""the most hunted person of the modern age"", and vowed that the family would not let the two princes' privacy be violated in the same way. Moves to increase the pro - tection of children were under discussion by the commission before the Princess's death. At present, section 12 of the Code of Practice states that children under 16 should not he ap - proached or photographed on the subject of the welfare of the child- without the permis - sion of a parent or guardian. Neither should they be ap - proached or photographed at school without the permission of the school. It is thought that a new sub - - clause to section 12 may"" be drafted to cover the photographing of children outside school and when they are over 16. Most tabloid editors de - clined to comment on the earl's remarks yesterday. An - drew Marr, Editor of The Independent, pledged that his newspaper would never again carry photographs, of the princes in private situations. Sir David English, who is
REGRET OVER INTERVIEW THE Princess re - gretted doing the BBC Panorama inter - view , according to her close friend Rosa Monckton. Writing in The Sunday Tele - graph , She described the interview as "" Di - ana at her worst"". The Princess was a ""con - flict of personalities"", complicated and simple and she had a dark side, she said. ""As the wounded ,
trapped animal she could be terrifying , and her infamous Pan - orama interview was an example of that. ' It was born of some basic desire to hurt those who she felt betrayed her. But she also had the ability to admit her mistakes, and she said to me that she regretted doing the programme. The sad thing is that it was her only television interview, and it was Diana at her worst,"" Monckton wrote.
chairman of the commission's code of practice committee and chairman of Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Evening Stan - dard , promised that the group would ""never use papa - razzi pictures of William while he is growing up"" . He believed that no other news - paper would either. ""I believe we in the Press have got to listen very much to what Spencer said—you cant ignore him,"" he said on the BBC TV's Breakfast With
Frost. Alan Rusbridger editor of The Guardian, said he believed that over the next two years any editor would be ""crazy"" to use an intrusive picture of the boys. They were ""safe"" for at least that period of time. Mr Rusbridger also said that broadsheet newspapers, which often used paparazzi pictures to illustrate stories about tabloid coverage of the Princess, should share some of the guilt. ""The broadsheets do sometimes like to have their cake and eat it."" Tony Hall, chief executive of BBC News, said that the public would hold the media accountable over privacy is - sues . ""Even if it's not possible to legislate on privacy, the fact that we are being held ac - countable for the decisions that we make about what goes into our newspapers and our broadcasting I think is abso - lutely right."" The Times has a policy of not using pictures it knows to have been taken in intrusive
circumstances, unless there is judged to be a significant public interest. Today in an editorial, Piers Morgan, Editor of The Mir - ror , says that he will work closely with the Press Com - plaints Commission to protect the young Princes from intru - sive photography. He con - cedes that the media must change after the Princess's death, but argues that she had had a more complex relation - ship with broadcasters and publishers than Lord Spencer had indicated in his angry speech. He says that the Princess recently met newspaper edi - tors to explain her goals and knew how to use the popular press. ""Readers of The Mirror know that, particularly since she started to rebuild her life two years ago,. we have been
almost entirely supportive of her. ""This was no accident. With her divorce looming, Diana took time to meet Editors and explain her concerns to them. To articulate her hopes and fears and to ask for our help in achieving her aims . . . ""Yes , Diana found the con - stant attention of p hotogra - phers irritating and on occasion their behaviour would enrage and upset her. But she also understood the power of the camera lens and popular press in communicat -
ing a helpful image—and she didn't hesitate to use that to great effect."" Tony Blair yesterday joined calls for newspapers and their proprietors to respond to pub - lic anger over the activities of the paparazzi. The Prime Minister made plain that he was taking a particular inter - est in the deliberations this week between the Press Com - p laints Commission and Edi - tors about tightening self - regulation . Mr Blair, who is sceptical about the advantages of pri -
vacy laws, is looking to the press to order tough new action. If proprietors an - nounce that they would no longer use intrusive p hoto - graph s from the paparazzi, except in cases justified by public interest, there would be no market in Britain for their work, he believes. On the Breakfast with Frost p ro - gramme , he said that it was a problem requiring ""more than the letter of the law"". It required acceptance of what was proper conduct. It was almost, he said, as if
the Royal Family had ceased to be treated as human beings and had become commodities to be traded round in photographs. ""We need to show compas - sion and generosity of spirit towards them in this situa - tion ,"" he said. He was not asking for an end to criticism but that newspapers should look at the ""boundaries of proper conduct"". Over the past few days, ministers have re-examined the arguments for a privacy law, but remain dubious.
However, it is possible that legislation will be introduced to prevent harassment by photographers using long - lens cameras if, for example, the press shows no sign of banning such action. Mr Blair pointed out that there were strong privacy laws in France, but there was a world market and there had to be a fundamental change of attitude. Nobody who heard the words of Lord Spencer in Westminster Abbey could have failed to feel the impact of that, he said.

"September 10, 1997","['Ben MacIntyre']","['News']","A THIRD set of tests on the body of Henri Paul, the chauf - feur of the car in which Diana, Princess of Wales, died, has confirmed that he was driving with more than three times the legal alcohol limit in his blood. The findings open the way for possible prosecution of his employers, the Paris Ritz ho - tel , owned by Mohamed Al Fayed. The tests, demanded by the family of the dead driver and Mr Al Fayed, were carried out by Paris Medical-Legal Insti - tute and indicated that M Paul , 41, had an alcohollevel of l.Sg of alcohol per litre of blood . The two earlier tests, carried out immediately after the acci - dent but challenged by Mr Al Fayed' and the Paul family, revealed levels of 1.75g and 1.85g per litre, roughly equiva - lent to drinking one and a half bottles of wine. The legal limit for driving in
France is 0.5g of alcohol per litre of blood. Yesterday's tests technically leave the management of the Ritz open to prosecution under French law on charges of ""negligence"" or ""endangering the life of another person"" for permitting M Paul to drive while intoxicated. M Paul, who was deputy director of security for the Paris Ritz, also allegedly lacked the qualifica - tions required to drive- the Mercedes . The funeral of M Paul, which was delayed pending the final tests, is expected to take place today in his home town of Lorient in Brittany. Nine photographers and a motorcycle driver , employed
by a photographic agency, said to be in pursuit of the Princess and Dodi Fayed, remain under formal legal investigation on charges of manslaughter and failure to assist the victims. In a further attempt to place blame for the crash on the paparazzi, Bernard Darte - velle , Mr Al Fayed's lawyer, claimed that a photograph taken just before the crash shows M Paul and the Princess's bodyguard appar - ently dazzled by the flash of a camera, while the Princess i.s turned around in the back sen: to look at a pursuing motorcy - cle . The photograph, and oth - ers indicating it was taken after their departure from the
Ritz, are in the possession of police, M Dartevelle said. Mr Al Fayed's lawyers have filed civil law suits against two publications and two picture agencies alleging they "" invad - ed the privacy and endan - gered the life"" of the Princesss and her friend by snatching photographs of them from a helicopter during their holi - day last month. They also claimed that two weeks before the fatal crash, the press was asked to stop harassing the couple. The suit alleges photographers work - ing for Paris Match, France Dimanche and two unidenti - fied agencies invaded the cou - p le 's privacy in the South of France. Investigating magistrates visited the Paris road tunnel where the crash took place for the first time yesterday, aim -
ing to reconstruct the events leading up to the tragedy. Although investigators have denied claims of a preliminary report indicating that the pho - tographers could not be held responsible for the accident, police are increasingly leaning towards the belief that the crash was caused by alcohol and excessive speed. Investigators have not come to a formal conclusion on the car's speed but police sources say they believe that it was being driven at more than 90mph. Max Coblence. the lawyer for two uf the photographers , said : """"There will have to be a re-enactment of . the accident before any decision is taken that might clear the photogra - p hers , and it will be some months before this can take place.""

"September 11, 1997","['David Churchill']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","THE LUXURY Ritz Hotel in Paris, owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, was yesterday named continental Europe's top business hotel in a poll of 48,000 business travellers who read Executive Travel magazine. The award, coming so soon after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales , and Mr Al Fayed's son Dodi and amid continuing rows over who was to blame for the accident, was made in London yesterday. The Savoy in London won the coveted Hotel of the Year award. It is the first time in the poll's 15-year history that an Asian hotel has not taken the major honour. The Savoy's award, however, has come at an embarrassing time: mice were reported to have been seen in the River Restaurant and running across the hotel's foyer. The Savoy blamed
recent refurbishment work for the problem. There had been suggestion by the organisers that awarding the ""Gold Medal"" for the top continental hotel to the Ritz in Paris was inappropriate in the circumstances but they decided to go ahead in fairness to the magazine's readers. The Paris Ritz — which has no connection with its London counterpart — has 142 rooms and 45 luxury suites. Double rooms cost up to £500 a night; the two-bedroom presidential suite costs almost £3,500 a night. The Ritz has always been the haunt of the rich and famous, including Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway. In more recent times the former MP Jonathan Aitken was also caught up in a damaging row over who paid his bill when staying at the Ritz.

Our sensibilities have become coarsened by this voyeurism. On Saturday I, like millions of others, sat with the Order of Service on my lap and watched the BBC's su - perb coverage of the funeral. There were no intrusive close-ups of the fam - ilies , no overfamiliar comment on those present or absent from the con - gregation and no paparazzi shots of the interment. A return by television to the decorum of Saturday would make us a more civilised people . Yours faithfully, CAROLINE BLAIR, 2 Greenhill Park, Edinburgh 10. September 9.
From Lieutenant-Colonel J. C. Walton [retd) Sir, While the television channels did a good job on Saturday showing us the events of the day, they must not feel they are the good boys of the media. They are there with the rest, in fact more powerful than newsprint. Yours faithfully, JOHN WALTON, Longworth Manor, Longworth, Nr Abingdon, Oxfordshire. September 8. From Mr John Chambers Sir, When I was learning my trade as a journalist, some 40 years ago, I was shown a copy of the house-style man - ual for a great national broadsheet daily of those days (it still publishes
but is now a,tabloid). One dictum in particular has always stuck in my mind: ""Would you write the story if it was about the pro - prietor or his family?"" That seems to me to be admirably succinct and, by and large, it still seems that editors find it prudent to observe the same guideline today. It certainly does not offer a cover-all cure-all for the worst contemporary news-hounding , but does it point a way? If journalists can constrain themselves to working within such v rule for the advantage of safeguarding their personal employment, this seems to suggest that a general rule of ordinary decency ought to be achiev - able if they were given some similar reason to apply their mind to it.
Yours faithfully, JOHN CHAMBERS, Clifford Cottage, 19 Clifford Chambers, Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire. September 8. From MrJ. E. Bradshaw Sir, To me the death of Diana, Prin - cess of Wales, was unbearably tragic, her funeral intensely moving. But I have also found the behaviour of the British public and media unbearable. The response and its coverage were totally excessive , the style for the most part mawkish, vulgar, self-indulgent and hysterical. And the conclusion that we are at some kind of national turning-point is presumptuous arro - ga n ce . The deployment of these excesses as an excuse to introduce ill-considered changes in the constitution and the conduct and role of the Royal Family is greatly to be regretted. For a week the many who think as I do have maintained a polite and shocked silence, mourning in our own way in the privacy of our homes. But no more. We deserve to be heard — it's our country too.

"September 11, 1997","['Ben MacIntyre']","['News']","THE complex and sometimes baf - fling French legal system has prompted anger and frustration in Britain and a flurry of conspiracy theories and semi-believable news stories in France. Traditionally, French legal inves - tigations are long, thorough and remarkably secretive, but the in - vestigation into the car crash on August 31 in which Diana, Princess of Wales, Dodi Fayed and their driver died is already one of the most extensive 'and intently scrutinised of modern times. The massive public interest in the Princess's death, coupled with intense media pressure, has led to a flood of stories, almost always from
Ben Macintyre looks at the external pressures on the officials investigating the events of August 31
unidentified sources and ranging from the plausible to the downright fictitious. The course of a French criminal inquiry depends to a large degree on the individual investigative magistrate fjuge d'instruction ) in charge. > ' He has almost complete freedom to decide which avenues to explore and what, if any, charges to bring. Under French law it is illegal for magistrates or police to disclose information on a case under inves - tigation . However, in high-profile cases information leaks out and
can be published with impunity although the leaker, if caught, faces prosecution. In the current case, investigators and police have spent more time denying stories than providing concrete information, despite diplo - matic nudging from Britain to be more open. In the past three days alone, the unidentified authorities have been forced to dismiss claims that a preliminary police report was leaning away from holding the pursuing paparazzi reponsible; that a police speed camera caught the car speeding at 122mph ; that
illegal drugs had been discovered in the wreck; and that money and a valuable necklace belonging to Mr Fayed had gone missing from the crash scene. On Tuesday, the Paris authori - ties swiftly released the results of blood tests confirming that .the car's chauffeur, Henri Paul; was driving with more than three times the legal alcohol limit in his blood. But it was not until pressurised by a series of leaks that the authorities conceded that traces of p harmaceu - tical drugs had also been found. The two magistrates leading the
investigation, Herve Stephan and Marie-Christine Devidal, have set their own pace from the start, when it was announced that instead of limiting the potential charges against photographers to ""failure to help persons in danger"" (as recommended by the public prose - cutor ), the investigation would be broadened to include "" manslaugh - ter "" and ""involuntary injury"". Under the French system, after any road accident the public prose - cutor first, rules on whether a judicial inquiry is merited. If so, an investigating magistrate is ap -
pointed who decide', whether any suspects should be placed under formal investigation (mis en exa - men ) and, if so, under which laws. The third, and to British eyes most confusing stage, is when the magistrate decides whether there is a case to 'answer that should proceed to trial. This can: take months, or even years, as the investigators compile and sift through evidence. Many French legal experts argue that releasing information in the course of an investigation hampers police work and undermines the
presumption of innocence, but the intervening period can be agonis - ing for the families of victims and those under investigation , while providing fertile ground for media supposition, if not plain invention. The magistrates in the case have already been accused of bowing to public and political pressure by widening the potential charges against those still under investiga - tion . Those accusations are certain to resurface, with a vengeance, if the investigators break with estab - lished tradition and suddenly begin to answer, in detail and on the record , some of the many unresolved questions surrounding the events of August 31.","SecreCTlea ^","1997-09-11","Secrecy leaves investigation open a speculation"
"September 11, 1997","['Barbara Broccoli']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","I jast spoke to Dodi on the Wednesday before his death. He called me from the boat. Our conversation was brief because he was very concerned that the press was tapping into his cellular phone. He told me that he was happier then he had ever been in his life. I believed him, not just because he told me so but because I knew he did not need or want anyone else around. Dodi knew Diana, Princess of Wales, only socially before the holiday in France this year. When he got back, he told me that he had had the most wonderful time with her, and that her sons were fantastic. But they did not begin their romance until later, when they could be together in private. This was the very thing that I wanted and longed for him to have in his life — to love someone so deeply that he could feel secure enough not to need his other friends around. Usually on his holidays he would call me and others to join him to spend time with him on the boat. Over the past few weeks he had found the love he had longed for all his life and just wanted to be alone with her. He told me that they were returning to London on Sunday and that we would see him on
Monday. On Saturday evening, just before I went to bed, I turned on CNN and heard about the accident. As soon as the Princess was mentioned, my first thought was to phone Dodi to see if she was all right . I couldn't believe the words I was hearing when they said that her compan - ion , Dodi Fayed, was dead. ""No , not my Dodi, my beloved friend, the man who had been like a brother for 26 years, it's not possible,"" I thought. And as the hours unfolded, so did the dreadful news that the Princess was dead also. That night, seeing the pictures of thecar mangled, the terrible pain of it all was like the worst nightmare . Dodi was obsessive about safety — he hated fast cars. The reports that he would have urged the driver to go faster are absurd. He was terrified of speed and so cautious that in the past five years he didn't even like to drive himself and was fastidious about who drove him. When my husband, Fred, drove anywhere , he would become wor - ried , even at normal speed, urging him to be careful, and shouting: ""We 're not iri hurry you know.""
Barbara Broccoli daughter of Bond film-maker Cubby Broccoli, was a close friend of Dodi Fayed. Here she talks about an 'absolute gentleman'
He was even more protective about his friends. Whenever I arranged to meet him he would send a driver, and ring me in the car to check that I was all right. Once he even refused to let me and my five-year-old daughter, Angeli - ca , get into a lift because he thought it looked unsafe. He was also paranoid about drinking and safety. Two weeks before the accident, Dodi and Fred met in Soho to see a private viewing of the new film, Contact. When Fred mentioned that he had had two beers in a pub on Dean Street beforehand , Dodi would not even let him wait on the street for a taxi,
in case something hap - pened to him. He insist - ed on taking Fred all the way home to Chelsea and walked him into the. house. The footage of Dodi and the Princess at the back entrance to the Ritz on the night they died shows Dodi face to face with Henri Paul. Had Dodi smelt even ihe faintest whiff of alcohol on his breath, it would have been inconceivable
'Dodi had found the love he'd longed for all his life'
would tell me how five or six years later when he bumped into them he would remember them and invite them to join him. The fact that Dodi was an intensely private person has only fuelled speculation about his love life. He was very, very discreet about all his relationships and fiercely loyal to those who trusted him. Even when ex-girlfriends
for him to get into that car. There is just no way he would have done it. The only thing Dodi would have wanted would be to protect the Princess. All they wanted was to have a quiet dinner alone together. When Dodi and I met, I was 11, and he was 16. My sister, Tina, and I met him through friends at the American School in London. Dodi, who loved the cinema, used to visit my father's film sets. We became part of his family and he became part of ours. Through us. Cubby and Mohamed became friends. Since that early age, Dodi and I never lost contact. We spoke regu - larly , several times a week. As a teenager, he was painfully shy , timid and softly spoken. As he got older he became a great socialiser and a brilliant sportsman and was rather sophisticated, but he never lost his shyness. That, combined with his good looks and an almost childlike gentleness,
made him incredibly attractive to women. To label him as a playboy is completely inaccurate. He did date many beautiful women but they chased him — not the other way round. Despite their attentions he never became pretentious or arrogant. Dodi felt very at ease in female company and loved to lavish affec - tion on those he cared about. He was an absolute gentleman — caring, thoughtful, polite and ex - tremely generous. He was the kind of person who would remember your favourite things when you came over for dinner. Friends of mine who met him only briefly
were talking to the press in June, he tried to rise above the accusations. Kelly Fisher's story of her sup - posedly broken engagement hurt him deeply, but he tried to shrug it off. I met Kelly on June 18 this year. It was my birthday and Dodi had organised a dinner for me at Annabel's. I spoke to Kelly at length, she seemed pleasant. I was one of Dodi's dearest and oldest friends — if they had beenplanning to marry, one of them would have told me that night. Dodi was a romantic, he led from the heart. Even when he split up from his wife of eight months, Suzanne Gregard, it ended amica - bly and Dodi wasn't negative about her. He was philosophical instead. In recent years Dodi had become quieter. He enjoyed family occa - sions , watching films, intimate dinners and staying at home with friends. Dodi often joined my family for
Thanksgiving. 1 remember one occasion in LA when he left an enormous bouquet of flowers in the back of his car. He said: ""These are for your mother, but give them to her when I'm gone."" He was too shy to bring them into the house. Dodi also loved dogs. Once he had a neurotic, scrappy little collie which he rescued from the pound. Its vocal cords had been removed so it could not bark. He was so upset at its mistreatment that he brought it home and fed it by-hand and slept with it. He arranged his life around that dog. We used to tease him about it.
The suggestion that Dodi wasted his life is a disgrace. He knew that he had had a privileged life and he appreciated it, but didn't flaunt it. At the age of 23, he set up his own production company, Allied Stars , and had produced six movies by the time he died — Breaking Class, Chariots of Fire, FIX Murder By Illusion , FIX2 The Deadly Art of Illusion, Hook and The Scarlet Letter. Chariots of Fire, which he co - produced , would not have been made without him. But he was modest about his contribution. At the 1981 Oscars, when Chariots of
Fire won Best Film, and David Puttnam, the producer, was pre - paring to go on stage, I said: ""Go on Dodi, get up, it's your film too."" He just sat there quietly and answered : ""No BB, I'll go next time."" Dodi was also deeply involved in his father's empire. As Mohamed Al Fayed's eldest son, he had an incredible responsibility towards his family. Mohamed and Dodi worshipped each other. It is too painful to speculate about what would have happened had they lived. I used to say: ""Dodi , you have to settle down and have a family of your own one day."" He
would reply: ""My life is already blessed with so many children — my little sisters and brothers, and Angelica."" But he did want a close relationship with someone, and was looking out for the right person to love. I am glad in a way that even I didn't know very much about their last week together. Whatever it was like for them, it will remain sacred because no one can talk about it. But I do know Dodi, and in those weeks before they died he would have loved her well. Barbara Broccoli was talking to Bridget Harrison.

"September 11, 1997","['Ben MacIntyre and Helen Johnstone']","['News']","MANAGEMENT at the Paris Ritz are at risk of being investigated for allowing a chauffeur under the influence of drink and drugs todri%'ethe car in which Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed. After yesterday's disclosure that Henri Paul was on drugs used to treat alcoholism, sources close to the inquiry said that it could be widened and that Ritz staff might be called in for questioning. Under French Jaw, managers of Mohamed Al Fayed's hotel could be prosecuted for negli - gence and endangering the life of others. Lawyers for the photogra - phers under investigation for manslaughter said that the drug tests, which showed traces of Prozac and Tiapridal, proved that M Paul, the hotel's deputy security director, was responsible for the accident. But Michael Cole, spokes -

man for Mr Al Fayed, called for an independent post - mortem . Speaking to the American television company NBC, he criticised the "" se lec - t ive and piecemeal"" way in which information on M Paul had been released. ""We think that there should be one investigation that answers all of the questions."" Mr Cole blamed the French authorities. ""Ten days ago we learnt about the drink — today we hear about the drugs. It needs to be sorted out what is fact, what is fiction and what should be disregarded. ""Mohamed Al Fayed is shocked and appalled by these
latest revelations. He con - demns , in absolute terms, drinking and driving ... if M Paul is guilty then we con - demn this absolutely."" Mr Cole said that three days before the accident M Paul had passed medical tests in France for the renewal of his pilot 's licence. Later he added that there had never been any problem with his behaviour during the 11 years he worked at the Ritz. ""Had he given any hint of being an alcoholic he would have been summarily dismissed."" In Paris last night, Mr Al Fayed's lawyer, Bernard Dartevelle, said : ""M Paul
should hever have got behind the wheel. He was without doubt the only one who knew his own condition. ""If his condition had been known, perhaps despite the haste in which all that hap - pened , he could have been prevented from leaving,"" he told French television. The Medical-Legal Institute in Paris on Tuesday confirmed that a third set of blood tests showed that M Paul had 1.80g of alcohol per litre of blood. The legal limit for driving in France is 0.5g per litre. The tests also found significant traces of Prozac, which can enhance the effect of alcohol in some individuals and may also cause drowsiness, confu - sion and dizziness. Prozac comes with a warning that it can impair driving. In theory Tiapridal should be obtained with a doctor's prescription, but it can be bought over the counter from French chemists. Tiapridal is accompanied by instructions that say patients should be warned about the
danger of drowsiness and that they should be advised against using it in conjunction with other medication. The drug's manufacturer ,says that alco - hol should be avoided during treatment because it further slows'the reflexes. A French doctor said yester - day that anyone consuming
such a quantity of drink, along with two powerful drugs , was ""probably falling apart"", let alone in a state to drive a powerful car at high speed under tense conditions. Clifford Rose, chief neurolo - gist at the London Neurologi - cal Centre, said: ""We advise people taking anti-depressant
drugs not to drink, but I don't think in this case the mixture of alcohol and drugs would have made much difference. The point is that- these are drugs which affect the central nervous system. They tend to overcome involuntary jerks , but they inevitably affect skills like the ability to drive.""

"September 13, 1997","['Ruth Gledhill']","['Feature Articles (aka Opinion)']","The composer John Tav - e ner , 53, wrote the haunt - ing piece that brought to a close last Saturday's funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. Song for Athene was orig i - nally written to commemorate another young woman, a family friend, Athene Hariades, who was killed on her bicycle in a road accident. Tavener knew neither Athene nor the Princess in life, but says he feels he has come to know them both in death. His music has been described as ""latp Cathie musical
write a piece for a soprano solo. It was not my way to go to the park and light a candle. It is my way to write music. This piece seemed to be covenanted to her."" He will finish it at the end of the month when he returns to the Greek island where he lives with his wife, Marianna, and their two young daughters, Theodora, ""gift of God"", and Sophia, ""wisdom "". The new work is based on a line from William Blake: ""He who kisses the joy as it flies lives in Eternity's sunrise"". Tavener was
wallpaper"". He is dis - missed as a ""mystic minimalist"" . But it was when the choir at Westminster Abbey began Tavener's Athe - ne , with its opening line, ""And flights of angels sing thee to thy . rest"", taken from Ho - ratio 's iast words to the dying Hamlet, that the full extent of the na - tion 's grief set in. Athe - ne sold out in the shops within days of the funeral and Tavener's latest release, Syyati, is at the top of the classi - cal music chart. After composing more
'When I am not writing music I feel bereft of the divine presence. Music is a kind of prayer tome '
brought up in the Pres - [ byterian church, where his fathei played the organ, bul he converted to Ortho - doxy when he was 30. The rest of the words oi Athene are taken from the Russian Orthodox funeral service. He started compos - ing at the age of three ""Music was my way, prayer was every - thing ,"" he says. ""Even at the age of three I was improvising on the piano and playing the same record over and over again."" A few years later, he was
pieces than he can count, he says writing music is, for him,' akin to prayer. He is now working on a piece for the Princess herself . ""Something that happens to me on the death of people, whether I know them or not, is that they seem to leave a parting gift,"" he says. ""I did not know Athene in life but felt I got to know her in death. Very quickly a piece came to me. At Diana's death, again I did not know her, but it felt as though there was some parting gift. ""I started to
giving public perfor - mances . Inspiration for his best works in recent years has come from his ""spiritual mother"", Moth - er Thekla, Abbess of the Orthodox monastery at Normanby in York - shire , whom he telephones daily. He is a descendant of the 16th - century sacred music composer JohnTaverner and is just as prolific although he does not know how many pieces he has written. "" Hun - dreds "" is as close an estimate as he can make. ""When I am not writing music I feel bereft of the divine
presence,"" he says. ""Writing music is a kind of prayer. The process exhausts me. Sometimes when I am writing intensely, going to church is difficult. I have no energy left for formal prayer. I do not feel I have the right to receive commu - nion because I am too exhausted."" It grieves him that the Prince of
Wales is unappreciated. He is working on a piece for the millenni - um , in memory of his late father, that is dedicated to the Prince. ""He is a tremendous searcher. He loves Orthodoxy , which is another rea - son I was glad that song was sung at the funeral."" He describes him - self as close to the Prince of Wales
and speculates that the Prince might at heart be an Orthodox Christian, as his father was before him. On the day we spoke, he had just returned from the funeral of an Orthodox woman in her eighties. ""It was so tender, so personal, everyone standing around the open
coffin with candles, with no pomp, no ceremony."" He can understand why so many are turning to Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam. ""There is an enormous humility there which does not seem to be present in the Western church. I can only see a future for Christian - ity if the whole world becomes
Orthodox."" Then he adds: ""In the last weeks of Princess Diana's life, when she was in Greece, she asked if she could see the Ecumenical Patriarch. She was not able to, unfortunately. I could not say whether she was interested in Orthodoxy . But I think she was, in her own way, searching .""
